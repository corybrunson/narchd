TI  - Physician's peer exposure and the adoption of a new cancer treatment modality.
PG  - 2799-807
LID - 10.1002/cncr.29409 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: New technologies, often with limited evidence to support their
      effectiveness, frequently diffuse into clinical practice and increase the costs
      of cancer care. The authors studied whether physician peer exposure was
      associated with the subsequent adoption of a new approach to adjuvant
      radiotherapy (brachytherapy) for the treatment of women with early-stage breast
      cancer. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed using Surveillance,
      Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare data. Data from 2003 through 2004
      were used to classify surgeons as early brachytherapy adopters and, among
      non-early adopters, whether they shared patients with early adopters (peer
      exposure). Data from 2005 through 2006 were used to examine whether women were
      more likely to receive brachytherapy if their surgeons were exposed to early
      adopters. RESULTS: Overall, the percentage of women receiving brachytherapy
      increased from 3.2% in 2003 through 2004 to 4.7% in 2005 through 2006. In this
      latter period, a total of 2087 patients were assigned to 328 non-early adopting
      surgeons. In unadjusted analyses, patients whose surgeons were connected to early
      adopters during 2003 through 2004 were found to be significantly more likely to
      receive brachytherapy in 2005 through 2006 compared with those whose surgeons
      were not connected to early adopters (8.0% vs 4.1%; P = .003). In adjusted
      analyses, the predicted probability of receiving brachytherapy among patients
      whose surgeon did have an early-adopting peer was 3.9% versus 1.0% among those
      whose surgeons did not have an early-adopting peer (P = .03). CONCLUSIONS:
      Exposure to peers who were early adopters of brachytherapy was found to be
      associated with a surgeon's subsequent uptake of brachytherapy. The results of
      the current study provide an example of a novel approach to examining the
      diffusion of innovation in cancer care. Cancer 2015;121:2799-2807. (c) 2015

TI  - Longitudinal medical records as a complement to routine drug safety signal
      analysis.
PG  - 486-94
LID - 10.1002/pds.3739 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To explore whether and how longitudinal medical records could be used as
      a source of reference in the early phases of signal detection and analysis of
      novel adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in a global pharmacovigilance database.
      METHODS: Drug and ADR combinations from the routine signal detection process of
      VigiBase(R) in 2011 were matched to combinations in The Health Improvement
      Network (THIN). The number and type of drugs and ADRs from the data sets were
      investigated. For unlabelled combinations, graphical display of longitudinal
      event patterns (chronographs) in THIN was inspected to determine if the pattern
      supported the VigiBase combination. RESULTS: Of 458 combinations in the VigiBase 
      data set, 190 matched to corresponding combinations in THIN (after excluding
      drugs with less than 100 prescriptions in THIN). Eighteen percent of the VigiBase
      and 9% of the matched THIN combinations referred to new drugs reported with
      serious reactions. Of the 112 unlabelled combinations matched to THIN, 52
      chronographs were inconclusive mainly because of lack of data; 34 lacked any
      outstanding pattern around the time of prescription; 24 had an elevation of
      events in the pre-prescription period, hence weakened the suspicion of a drug
      relationship; two had an elevated pattern of events exclusively in the
      post-prescription period that, after review of individual patient histories, did 
      not support an association. CONCLUSIONS: Longitudinal medical records were useful
      in understanding the clinical context around a drug and suspected ADR combination
      and the probability of a causal relationship. A drawback was the paucity of data 
      for newly marketed drugs with serious reactions.

      validated? Study 2--the effect of beta-adrenoceptor blocker therapy on cancer
      survival: a retrospective cohort study.
PG  - e007299
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2014-007299 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To conduct a fully independent, external validation of a research
      study based on one electronic health record database using a different database
      sampling from the same population. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort analysis of
      beta-blocker therapy and all-cause mortality in patients with cancer. SETTING:
      Two UK national primary care databases (PCDs): the Clinical Practice Research
      Datalink (CPRD) and Doctors' Independent Network (DIN). PARTICIPANTS: CPRD data
      for 11,302 patients with cancer compared with published results from DIN for 3462
      patients; study period January 1997 to December 2006. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY
      OUTCOME MEASURES: All-cause mortality: overall; by treatment subgroup
      (beta-blockers only, beta-blockers plus other blood pressure lowering medicines
      (BPLM), other BPLMs only); and by cancer site. RESULTS: Using CPRD, beta-blocker 
      use was not associated with mortality (HR=1.03, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.14, vs patients 
      prescribed other BPLMs only), but DIN beta-blocker users had significantly higher
      mortality (HR=1.18, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.33). However, these HRs were not
      statistically different (p=0.063), but did differ for patients on beta-blockers
      alone (CPRD=0.94, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.07; DIN=1.37, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.61; p<0.001).
      Results for individual cancer sites differed by study, but only significantly for
      prostate and pancreas cancers. Results were robust under sensitivity analyses,
      but we could not be certain that mortality was identically defined in both
      databases. CONCLUSIONS: We found a complex pattern of similarities and
      differences between databases. Overall treatment effect estimates were not
      statistically different, adding to a growing body of evidence that different UK
      PCDs produce comparable effect estimates. However, individually the two studies
      lead to different conclusions regarding the safety of beta-blockers and some
      subgroup effects differed significantly. Single studies using even internally
      well-validated databases do not guarantee generalisable results, especially for
      subgroups, and confirmatory studies using at least one other independent data
      source are strongly recommended.

TI  - Changing roles of population-based cancer registries in Australia.
LID - 10.1071/AH14250 [doi]
AB  - Registries have key roles in cancer incidence, mortality and survival monitoring 
      and in showing disparities across the population. Incidence monitoring began in
      New South Wales in 1972 and other jurisdictions soon followed. Registry data are 
      used to evaluate outcomes of preventive, screening, treatment and support
      services. They have shown decreases in cancer incidence following interventions
      and have been used for workforce and other infrastructure planning. Crude markers
      of optimal radiotherapy and chemotherapy exist and registry data are used to show
      shortfalls against these markers. The data are also used to investigate cancer
      clusters and environmental concerns. Survival data are used to assess service
      performance and interval cancer data are used in screening accreditation.
      Registries enable determination of risk of multiple primary cancers. Clinical
      quality registries are used for clinical quality improvement. Population-based
      cancer registries and linked administrative data complement clinical registries
      by providing high-level system-wide data. The USA Commission on Cancer has long
      used registries for quality assurance and service accreditation. Increasingly
      population-based registry data in Australia are linked with administrative data
      on service delivery to assess system performance. Addition of tumour stage and
      other prognostic indicators is important for these analyses and is facilitated by
      the roll-out of structured pathology reporting. Data linkage with administrative 
      data, following checks on the quality of these data, enables assessment of
      patterns of care and other performance indicators for health-system monitoring.
      Australian cancer registries have evolved and increasingly are contributing to
      broader information networks for health system management.

      records with systems science models.
PG  - e64
LID - 10.2196/jmir.3082 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The global burden of disease is increasingly dominated by
      non-communicable diseases.These diseases are less amenable to curative and
      preventative interventions than communicable disease. This presents a challenge
      to medical practice and medical research, both of which are experiencing
      diminishing returns from increasing investment. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to (1)
      review how medical knowledge is generated, and its limitations, (2) assess the
      potential for emerging technologies and ideas to improve medical research, and
      (3) suggest solutions and recommendations to increase medical research efficiency
      on non-communicable diseases. METHODS: We undertook an unsystematic review of
      peer-reviewed literature and technology websites. RESULTS: Our review generated
      the following conclusions and recommendations. (1) Medical knowledge continues to
      be generated in a reductionist paradigm. This oversimplifies our models of
      disease, rendering them ineffective to sufficiently understand the complex nature
      of non-communicable diseases. (2) Some of these failings may be overcome by
      adopting a "Systems Medicine" paradigm, where the human body is modeled as a
      complex adaptive system. That is, a system with multiple components and levels
      interacting in complex ways, wherein disease emerges from slow changes to the
      system set-up. Pursuing systems medicine research will require larger datasets.
      (3) Increased data sharing between researchers, patients, and clinicians could
      provide this unmet need for data. The recent emergence of electronic health care 
      records (EHR) could potentially facilitate this in real-time and at a global
      level. (4) Efforts should continue to aggregate anonymous EHR data into large
      interoperable data silos and release this to researchers. However, international 
      collaboration, data linkage, and obtaining additional information from patients
      will remain challenging. (5) Efforts should also continue towards "Medicine 2.0".
      Patients should be given access to their personal EHR data. Subsequently, online 
      communities can give researchers the opportunity to ask patients for direct
      access to the patient's EHR data and request additional study-specific
      information. However, selection bias towards patients who use Web 2.0 technology 
      may be difficult to overcome. CONCLUSIONS: Systems medicine, when combined with
      large-scale data sharing, has the potential to raise our understanding of
      non-communicable diseases, foster personalized medicine, and make substantial
      progress towards halting, curing, and preventing non-communicable diseases.
      Large-scale data amalgamation remains a core challenge and needs to be supported.
      A synthesis of "Medicine 2.0" and "Systems Science" concepts into "Systems
      Medicine 2.0" could take decades to materialize but holds much promise.

TI  - Visualizing collaborative electronic health record usage for hospitalized
      patients with heart failure.
PG  - 299-311
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocu017 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To visualize and describe collaborative electronic health record (EHR)
      usage for hospitalized patients with heart failure. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We
      identified records of patients with heart failure and all associated healthcare
      provider record usage through queries of the Northwestern Medicine Enterprise
      Data Warehouse. We constructed a network by equating access and updates of a
      patient's EHR to a provider-patient interaction. We then considered shared
      patient record access as the basis for a second network that we termed the
      provider collaboration network. We calculated network statistics, the modularity 
      of provider interactions, and provider cliques. RESULTS: We identified 548
      patient records accessed by 5113 healthcare providers in 2012. The provider
      collaboration network had 1504 nodes and 83 998 edges. We identified 7 major
      provider collaboration modules. Average clique size was 87.9 providers. We used a
      graph database to demonstrate an ad hoc query of our provider-patient network.
      DISCUSSION: Our analysis suggests a large number of healthcare providers across a
      wide variety of professions access records of patients with heart failure during 
      their hospital stay. This shared record access tends to take place not only in a 
      pairwise manner but also among large groups of providers. CONCLUSION: EHRs encode
      valuable interactions, implicitly or explicitly, between patients and providers. 
      Network analysis provided strong evidence of multidisciplinary record access of
      patients with heart failure across teams of 100+ providers. Further investigation
      may lead to clearer understanding of how record access information can be used to
      strategically guide care coordination for patients hospitalized for heart
      failure.

TI  - Receipt of chemotherapy among medicare patients with cancer by type of
      supplemental insurance.
PG  - 312-8
LID - 10.1200/JCO.2014.55.3107 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Medicare beneficiaries with cancer bear a greater portion of their
      health care costs, because cancer treatment costs have increased. Beneficiaries
      have supplemental insurance to reduce out-of-pocket costs; those without
      supplemental insurance may face barriers to care. This study examines the
      association between type of supplemental insurance coverage and receipt of
      chemotherapy among Medicare patients with cancer who, per National Comprehensive 
      Cancer Network treatment guidelines, should generally receive chemotherapy.
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective, observational study included 1,200
      Medicare patients diagnosed with incident cancer of the breast (stage IIB to
      III), colon (stage III), rectum (stage II to III), lung (stage II to IV), or
      ovary (stage II to IV) from 2000 to 2005. Using the National Cancer Institute
      Patterns of Care Studies and linked SEER-Medicare data, we determined each
      Medicare patient's supplemental insurance status (private insurance, dual
      eligible [ie, Medicare with Medicaid], or no supplemental insurance),
      consultation with an oncologist, and receipt of chemotherapy. Using adjusted
      logistic regression, we evaluated the association of type of supplemental
      insurance with oncologist consultation and receipt of chemotherapy. RESULTS:
      Dual-eligible patients were significantly less likely to receive chemotherapy
      than were Medicare patients with private insurance. Patients with Medicare only
      who saw an oncologist had comparable rates of chemotherapy compared with Medicare
      patients with private insurance. CONCLUSION: Dual-eligible Medicare beneficiaries
      received recommended cancer chemotherapy less frequently than other Medicare
      beneficiaries. With the increasing number of Medicaid patients under the
      Affordable Care Act, there will be a need for patient navigators and sufficient
      physician reimbursement so that low-income patients with cancer will have access 
      to oncologists and needed treatment.

TI  - A mobile app for securely capturing and transferring clinical images to the
      electronic health record: description and preliminary usability study.
PG  - e1
LID - 10.2196/mhealth.3481 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Photographs are important tools to record, track, and communicate
      clinical findings. Mobile devices with high-resolution cameras are now
      ubiquitous, giving clinicians the opportunity to capture and share images from
      the bedside. However, secure and efficient ways to manage and share digital
      images are lacking. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to describe the
      implementation of a secure application for capturing and storing clinical images 
      in the electronic health record (EHR), and to describe initial user experiences. 
      METHODS: We developed CliniCam, a secure Apple iOS (iPhone, iPad) application
      that allows for user authentication, patient selection, image capture, image
      annotation, and storage of images as a Portable Document Format (PDF) file in the
      EHR. We leveraged our organization's enterprise service-oriented architecture to 
      transmit the image file from CliniCam to our enterprise clinical data repository.
      There is no permanent storage of protected health information on the mobile
      device. CliniCam also required connection to our organization's secure WiFi
      network. Resident physicians from emergency medicine, internal medicine, and
      dermatology used CliniCam in clinical practice for one month. They were then
      asked to complete a survey on their experience. We analyzed the survey results
      using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Twenty-eight physicians participated and
      19/28 (68%) completed the survey. Of the respondents who used CliniCam, 89% found
      it useful or very useful for clinical practice and easy to use, and wanted to
      continue using the app. Respondents provided constructive feedback on location of
      the photos in the EHR, preferring to have photos embedded in (or linked to)
      clinical notes instead of storing them as separate PDFs within the EHR. Some
      users experienced difficulty with WiFi connectivity which was addressed by
      enhancing CliniCam to check for connectivity on launch. CONCLUSIONS: CliniCam was
      implemented successfully and found to be easy to use and useful for clinical
      practice. CliniCam is now available to all clinical users in our hospital,
      providing a secure and efficient way to capture clinical images and to insert
      them into the EHR. Future clinical image apps should more closely link clinical
      images and clinical documentation and consider enabling secure transmission over 
      public WiFi or cellular networks.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To improve the efficiency and appropriateness of computed
      tomography (CT) use in children with minor head trauma, clinical prediction rules
      were derived and validated by the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research
      Network (PECARN). The objective of this study was to conduct a cost-effectiveness
      analysis comparing the PECARN traumatic brain injury prediction rules to usual
      care for selective CT use. METHODS: We used decision analytic modeling to project
      the outcomes, costs, and cost-effectiveness of applying the PECARN rules compared
      with usual care in a hypothetical cohort of 1,000 children with minor blunt head 
      trauma. Clinical management was directed by level of risk as specified by the
      presence or absence of variables in the PECARN traumatic brain injury prediction 
      rules. Immediate costs of care (diagnostic testing, treatment [not including
      clinician time], and hospital stay) were derived on single-center data.
      Quality-adjusted life-year losses related to the sequelae of clinically important
      traumatic brain injuries and to radiation-induced cancers, number of CT scans,
      number of radiation-induced cancers, number of missed clinically important
      traumatic brain injury, and total costs were evaluated. RESULTS: Compared with
      the usual care strategy, the PECARN strategy was projected to miss slightly more 
      children with clinically important traumatic brain injuries (0.26 versus 0.02 per
      1,000 children) but used fewer cranial CT scans (274 versus 353), resulted in
      fewer radiation-induced cancers (0.34 versus 0.45), cost less ($904,940 versus
      $954,420), and had lower net quality-adjusted life-year loss (-4.64 versus
      -5.79). Because the PECARN strategy was more effective (less quality-adjusted
      life-year loss) and less costly, it dominated the usual care strategy. Results
      were robust under sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSION: Application of the PECARN
      traumatic brain injury prediction rules for children with minor head trauma would
      lead to beneficial outcomes and more cost-effective care.

TI  - Structured assessment for prospective identification of safety signals in
      electronic medical records: evaluation in the health improvement network.
PG  - 87-100
LID - 10.1007/s40264-014-0251-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pharmacovigilance signal detection largely relies on individual case 
      reports, but longitudinal health data are being explored as complementary
      information sources. Research to date has focused on the ability of
      epidemiological methods to distinguish established adverse drug reactions (ADRs) 
      from unrelated adverse events. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate a
      process for structured clinical and epidemiological assessment of temporally
      associated drugs and medical events in electronic medical records. METHODS: Pairs
      of drugs and medical events were selected for review on the basis of their
      temporal association according to a calibrated self-controlled cohort analysis in
      The Health Improvement Network. Six assessors trained in pharmacovigilance and/or
      epidemiology evaluated seven drugs each, with up to 20 medical events per drug. A
      pre-specified questionnaire considered aspects related to the nature of the
      temporal pattern, demographic features of the cohort, concomitant medicines,
      earlier signs and symptoms, and possible confounding by underlying disease. This 
      informed a classification of drug-event pairs as known ADRs, meriting further
      evaluation, or dismissed. RESULTS: The number of temporally associated medical
      events per drug ranged from 11 to 307 (median 50) for the 42 selected drugs. Out 
      of the 509 relevant drug-event combinations subjected to the assessment, 127 (25 
      %) were classified as known ADRs. Ninety-one (24 %) of the remaining pairs were
      classified as potential signals meriting further evaluation and 291 (76 %) were
      dismissed. Suggestive temporal patterns and lack of clear alternative
      explanations were the most common reasons that drug-event pairs were classified
      as meriting further evaluation. Earlier signs and symptoms and confounding by the
      underlying disease were the most common reasons that drug-event pairs were
      dismissed. CONCLUSIONS: Exploratory analysis of electronic medical records can
      detect important potential safety signals. However, effective signal detection
      requires that statistical signal detection be combined with clinical and
      epidemiological review to achieve an acceptable false positive rate.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: We collaborated with the ImproveCareNow Network to create a
      proof-of-concept architecture for a network-based Learning Health System. This
      collaboration involved transitioning an existing registry to one that is linked
      to the electronic health record (EHR), enabling a "data in once" strategy. We
      sought to automate a series of reports that support care improvement while also
      demonstrating the use of observational registry data for comparative
      effectiveness research. DESCRIPTION OF ARCHITECTURE: We worked with three leading
      EHR vendors to create EHR-based data collection forms. We automated many of
      ImproveCareNow's analytic reports and developed an application for storing
      protected health information and tracking patient consent. Finally, we deployed a
      cohort identification tool to support feasibility studies and hypothesis
      generation. There is ongoing uptake of the system. To date, 31 centers have
      adopted the EHR-based forms and 21 centers are uploading data to the registry.
      Usage of the automated reports remains high and investigators have used the
      cohort identification tools to respond to several clinical trial requests.
      SUGGESTIONS FOR FUTURE USE: The current process for creating EHR-based data
      collection forms requires groups to work individually with each vendor. A
      vendor-agnostic model would allow for more rapid uptake. We believe that
      interfacing network-based registries with the EHR would allow them to serve as a 
      source of decision support. Additional standards are needed in order for this
      vision to be achieved, however. CONCLUSIONS: We have successfully implemented a
      proof-of-concept Learning Health System while providing a foundation on which
      others can build. We have also highlighted opportunities where sponsors could
      help accelerate progress.

TI  - A metabolic phenotype based on mitochondrial ribosomal protein expression as a
      predictor of lymph node metastasis in papillary thyroid carcinoma.
PG  - e380
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000000380 [doi]
AB  - Metabolic reprogramming has been regarded as an essential component of malignant 
      transformation. However, the clinical significance of metabolic heterogeneity
      remains poorly characterized. The aim of this study was to characterize metabolic
      heterogeneity in thyroid cancers via the analysis of the expression of
      mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (MRPs) and genes involved in oxidative
      phosphorylation (OxPhos), and investigate potential prognostic correlations. Gene
      set enrichment analysis (GSEA) verified by reverse transcription polymerase chain
      reaction and gene network analysis was performed using public repository data.
      Cross-sectional observational study was conducted to classify papillary thyroid
      cancer (PTC) by the expression of MRP L44 (MRPL44) messenger RNA (mRNA), and to
      investigate the clinicopathological features. GSEA clearly showed that the
      expression of OxPhos and MRP gene sets was significantly lower in primary thyroid
      cancer than in matched normal thyroid tissue. However, 8 of 49 primary thyroid
      tumors (16.3%) in the public repository did not show a reduction in OxPhos mRNA
      expression. Remarkably, strong positive correlations between MRPL44 expression
      and those of OxPhos and MRPs such as reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
      dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) 1 alpha subcomplex, 5; succinate dehydrogenase
      complex, subunit D; cytochrome c, somatic; adenosine triphosphate synthase, H+
      transporting, mitochondrial Fo complex, subunit C1 (subunit 9); and MRP S5
      (MRPS5) (P < 0.0001) were clearly denoted, suggesting that MRPL44 is a
      representative marker of OxPhos and MRP expressions. In laboratory experiments,
      metabolic heterogeneity in oxygen consumption, extracellular acidification rates 
      (ECARs), and amounts of OxPhos complexes were consistently observed in BCPAP,
      TPC1, HTH-7, and XTC.UC1 cell lines. In PTCs, metabolic phenotype according to
      OxPhos amount defined by expression of MRPL44 mRNA was significantly related to
      lymph node metastasis (LNM) (P < 0.001). Furthermore, multivariate analysis
      clearly indicated that expression of MRPL44 is associated with an increased risk 
      of lateral neck LNM (odds ratio 9.267, 95% confidence interval 1.852-46.371, P = 
      0.007). MRPL44 expression may be a representative marker of metabolic phenotype
      according to OxPhos amount and a useful predictor of LNM.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the use of aggregated and de-identified electronic
      health record (EHR) data for multivariate post-marketing pharmacosurveillance in 
      a case study of azathioprine (AZA). METHODS: Using aggregated, standardized,
      normalized, and de-identified, population-level data from the Explore platform
      (Explorys, Inc.) we searched over 10 million individuals, of which 14,580 were
      prescribed AZA based on RxNorm drug orders. Based on logical observation
      identifiers names and codes (LOINC) and vital sign data, we examined the
      following side effects: anemia, cell lysis, fever, hepatotoxicity, hypertension, 
      nephrotoxicity, neutropenia, and neutrophilia. Patients prescribed AZA were
      compared to patients prescribed one of 11 other anti-rheumatologic drugs to
      determine the relative risk of side effect pairs. RESULTS: Compared to AZA case
      report trends, hepatotoxicity (marked by elevated transaminases or elevated
      bilirubin) did not occur as an isolated event more frequently in patients
      prescribed AZA than other anti-rheumatic agents. While neutropenia occurred in
      24% of patients (RR 1.15, 95% CI 1.07-1.23), neutrophilia was also frequent (45%)
      and increased in patients prescribed AZA (RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.22-1.34). After
      constructing a pairwise side effect network, neutropenia had no dependencies. A
      reduced risk of neutropenia was found in patients with co-existing elevations in 
      total bilirubin or liver transaminases, supporting classic clinical knowledge
      that agranulocytosis is a largely unpredictable phenomenon. Rounding errors
      propagated in the statistically de-identified datasets for cohorts as small as 40
      patients only contributed marginally to the calculated risk. CONCLUSION: Our work
      demonstrates that aggregated, standardized, normalized and de-identified
      population level EHR data can provide both sufficient insight and statistical
      power to detect potential patterns of medication side effect associations,
      serving as a multivariate and generalizable approach to post-marketing drug
      surveillance.

PG  - 737-50
LID - 10.1007/s10278-014-9709-9 [doi]
AB  - Medical images exchanged over public networks require a methodology to provide
      confidentiality for the image, authenticity of the image ownership and source of 
      origin, and image integrity verification. To provide these three security
      requirements, we propose in this paper a region-based algorithm based on multiple
      watermarking in the frequency and spatial domains. Confidentiality and
      authenticity are provided by embedding robust watermarks in the
      region-of-non-interest (RONI) of the image using a blind scheme in the discrete
      wavelet transform and singular value decomposition domain (DWT-SVD). On the other
      hand, integrity is provided by embedding local fragile watermarks in the
      region-of-interest (ROI) of the image using a reversible scheme in the spatial
      domain. The integrity provided by the proposed algorithm is implemented on a
      block-level of the partitioned-image, thus enabling localized detection of
      tampered regions. The algorithm was evaluated with respect to imperceptibility,
      robustness, capacity, and tamper localization capability, using MRI, Ultrasound, 
      and X-ray gray-scale medical images. Performance results demonstrate the
      effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in providing the required security
      services for telemedicine applications.

TI  - Characteristics of patient portals developed in the context of health information
      exchanges: early policy effects of incentives in the meaningful use program in
      the United States.
PG  - e258
LID - 10.2196/jmir.3698 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In 2014, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services in the United
      States launched the second stage of its Electronic Health Record (EHR) Incentive 
      Program, providing financial incentives to providers to meaningfully use their
      electronic health records to engage patients online. Patient portals are
      electronic means to engage patients by enabling secure access to personal medical
      records, communication with providers, various self-management tools, and
      administrative functionalities. Outcomes of patient portals have mainly been
      reported in large integrated health systems. This may now change as the EHR
      Incentive Program enables and supports the use of patient portals in other types 
      of health systems. In this paper, we focus on Health Information Exchanges (HIE):
      entities that facilitate data exchange within networks of independent providers. 
      OBJECTIVE: In response to the EHR Incentive Program, some Health Information
      Exchanges in the United States are developing patient portals and offering them
      to their network of providers. Such patient portals hold high value for patients,
      especially in fragmented health system contexts, due to the portals' ability to
      integrate health information from an array of providers and give patients one
      access point to this information. Our aim was to report on the early effects of
      the EHR incentives on patient portal development by HIEs. Specifically, we
      describe the characteristics of these portals, identify factors affecting
      adoption by providers during the 2013-2014 time frame, and consider what may be
      the primary drivers of providers' adoption of patient portals in the future.
      METHODS: We identified four HIEs that were developing patient portals as of
      spring 2014. We collected relevant documents and conducted interviews with six
      HIE leaders as well as two providers that were implementing the portals in their 
      practices. We performed content analysis on these data to extract information
      pertinent to our study objectives. RESULTS: Our findings suggest that there are
      two primary types of patient portals available to providers in HIEs: (1) portals 
      linked to EHRs of individual providers or health systems and (2) HIE-sponsored
      portals that link information from multiple providers' EHRs. The decision of
      providers in the HIEs to adopt either one of these portals appears to be a
      trade-off between functionality, connectivity, and cost. Our findings also
      suggest that while the EHR Incentive Program is influencing these decisions, it
      may not be enough to drive adoption. Rather, patient demand for access to patient
      portals will be necessary to achieve widespread portal adoption and realization
      of potential benefits. CONCLUSIONS: Optimizing patient value should be the main
      principle underlying policies intending to increase online patient engagement in 
      the third stage of the EHR Incentive Program. We propose a number of features for
      the EHR Incentive Program that will enhance patient value and thereby support the
      growth and sustainability of patient portals provided by Health Information
      Exchanges.

TI  - Characteristics of clinical trial websites: information distribution between
      ClinicalTrials.gov and 13 primary registries in the WHO registry network.
PG  - 428
LID - 10.1186/1745-6215-15-428 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is well known that information about clinical trials is not easily
      accessible by the public. In Japan, clinical trial information can be accessed by
      the general public through online registries; however, many people find these
      registries difficult to use. To improve current clinical trial registries, we
      propose that combining them with clinical information phrased in lay terms would 
      be beneficial to other interested professionals such as journalists and
      clinicians, as well as the general public. Therefore, this study aimed to examine
      the current pattern of distribution of clinical trial information from the
      primary World Health Organization (WHO) registries. Based on the results of this 
      assessment, we then aimed to build and evaluate a prototype of the Japan Primary 
      Registries Network (JPRN) portal that would be easily accessible to patients and 
      the public, while still remaining useful for professionals. METHODS: We assessed 
      a total of 14 primary clinical trial registries listed on the WHO International
      Clinical Trials Registry Platform between January and February 2013. Website
      content was accessed and checked against a series of items that looked at
      usability, communication, design and accessibility of the sites. We excluded
      registries that were not active or were not on the approved WHO registry list at 
      the time of our assessment. We also examined only the English versions of the
      websites as native-language registries may offer more functionality or different 
      content than the English version of the same website. RESULTS: All registries
      examined had a function allowing users to search the registry data and that
      displayed the related information from the search, including the clinical trial
      registration data. However, few websites were found to be user-friendly, and
      there was little integration with social media. CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed that
      there are few websites providing useful clinical trial information to patients
      and their families. However, information gleaned from some of the more advanced
      online registries could be used to improve the content and functionality of the
      JPRN portal.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Alzheimer's disease and related dementias are common and costly, with 
      increased healthcare utilization for patients with these disorders. The current
      study describes a novel dementia detection program for veterans and examines
      whether program-eligible patients have higher healthcare utilization than
      age-matched comparison patients. DESIGN: Using a telephone-based case-finding
      approach, the detection program used risk factors available in the electronic
      medical record (EMR) and telephone-based brief cognitive screening. Holding
      illness severity constant, dementia detection and healthcare utilization were
      compared across age-matched groups with and without program risk factors.
      SETTING: Five Veterans Affairs Healthcare Network Upstate New York primary care
      clinics. PARTICIPANTS: Veterans aged 70 years and older. MEASUREMENTS: EMR data
      and the Charlson comorbidity index. RESULTS: Program-eligible patients (n =
      5,333) demonstrated significantly greater levels of medical comorbidity relative 
      to comparison patients and were on average more than twice as likely to be
      admitted to the hospital. They also had nearly double the number of outpatient
      visits to several services. Similar patterns were seen in those who screened
      positive on a brief cognitive measure, compared with those who screened negative.
      CONCLUSIONS: A novel program using EMR data to assist in the detection of newly
      diagnosed dementia in a clinical setting was found to be useful in identifying
      older veterans with multiple comorbid medical conditions and increased
      utilization of hospital and clinic services. Results suggest undetected cognitive
      impairment and dementia may significantly contribute to healthcare utilization
      and costs of care in older veterans.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies of the effects of electronic health records (EHRs) have had
      mixed findings, which may be attributable to unmeasured confounders such as
      individual variability in use of EHR features. OBJECTIVE: To capture
      physician-level variations in use of EHR features, associations with other
      predictors, and usage intensity over time. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of
      primary care providers eligible for meaningful use at a network of federally
      qualified health centers, using commercial EHR data from January 2010 through
      June 2013, a period during which the organization was preparing for and in the
      early stages of meaningful use. RESULTS: Data were analyzed for 112 physicians
      and nurse practitioners, consisting of 430,803 encounters with 99,649 patients.
      EHR usage metrics were developed to capture how providers accessed and added to
      patient data (eg, problem list updates), used clinical decision support (eg,
      responses to alerts), communicated (eg, printing after-visit summaries), and used
      panel management options (eg, viewed panel reports). Provider-level variability
      was high: for example, the annual average proportion of encounters with problem
      lists updated ranged from 5% to 60% per provider. Some metrics were associated
      with provider, patient, or encounter characteristics. For example, problem list
      updates were more likely for new patients than established ones, and alert
      acceptance was negatively correlated with alert frequency. CONCLUSIONS: Providers
      using the same EHR developed personalized patterns of use of EHR features. We
      conclude that physician-level usage of EHR features may be a valuable additional 
      predictor in research on the effects of EHRs on healthcare quality and costs.

TI  - Improving search over Electronic Health Records using UMLS-based query expansion 
      through random walks.
PG  - 100-6
LID - 10.1016/j.jbi.2014.04.013 [doi]
LID - S1532-0464(14)00098-7 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Most of the information in Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is
      represented in free textual form. Practitioners searching EHRs need to phrase
      their queries carefully, as the record might use synonyms or other related words.
      In this paper we show that an automatic query expansion method based on the
      Unified Medicine Language System (UMLS) Metathesaurus improves the results of a
      robust baseline when searching EHRs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The method uses a
      graph representation of the lexical units, concepts and relations in the UMLS
      Metathesaurus. It is based on random walks over the graph, which start on the
      query terms. Random walks are a well-studied discipline in both Web and Knowledge
      Base datasets. RESULTS: Our experiments over the TREC Medical Record track show
      improvements in both the 2011 and 2012 datasets over a strong baseline.
      DISCUSSION: Our analysis shows that the success of our method is due to the
      automatic expansion of the query with extra terms, even when they are not
      directly related in the UMLS Metathesaurus. The terms added in the expansion go
      beyond simple synonyms, and also add other kinds of topically related terms.
      CONCLUSIONS: Expansion of queries using related terms in the UMLS Metathesaurus
      beyond synonymy is an effective way to overcome the gap between query and
      document vocabularies when searching for patient cohorts.

TI  - Prescription of antihypertensive medications during pregnancy in the UK.
PG  - 1051-8
LID - 10.1002/pds.3641 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This study aimed to describe the management of antihypertensive
      medications in pregnancy by general practitioners in the UK and compare it with
      current guidelines. METHODS: We used electronic medical records from The Health
      Improvement Network database from 1996 to 2010 to identify completed pregnancies.
      The study cohort included the first pregnancy identified during the study period 
      in women aged 13-49 years. Information on both hypertension diagnoses and
      prescription of specific antihypertensive medications within the 90 days before
      the last menstrual period (LMP) and during pregnancy was ascertained from
      electronic medical records. RESULTS: Among 148,544 eligible pregnancies, we
      identified 1995 (1.3%) during which the women had pre-existing hypertension
      diagnosed by the LMP date. Overall, the prevalence of antihypertensive
      medications during the first trimester was 1.5%; beta-blockers were the most
      commonly prescribed antihypertensive. Among women with pre-existing hypertension,
      36% were prescribed an antihypertensive medication during the 90 days before the 
      LMP. Among those, 9.6% and 22.2% had discontinued their medication by the first
      and second trimesters, respectively. For contraindicated drugs such as
      angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers,
      the corresponding discontinuation rates were around 25% and 70%. Women who
      switched therapy received preferably either methyldopa or an alpha/beta-blocker. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In this population of UK pregnant women, prescription patterns of
      antihypertensive medications were dominated by recommended treatments, although
      some patients continued on contraindicated drugs throughout pregnancy or switched
      to preferred agents in a delayed fashion.

AB  - The introduction of computers into general practice settings has profoundly
      changed the dynamics of the clinical consultation. Previous research exploring
      the impact of the computer (in what has been termed the 'triadic' consultation)
      has shown that computer use and communication between doctor and patient are
      intricately coordinated and inseparable. Swinglehurst et al. have recently been
      critical of the ongoing tendency within health communication research to focus on
      'the computer' as a relatively simple 'black box', or as a material presence in
      the consultation. By re-focussing on the electronic patient record (EPR) and
      conceptualising this as a complex collection of silent but consequential voices, 
      they have opened up new and more nuanced possibilities for analysis. This
      orientation makes visible a tension between the immediate contingencies of the
      interaction as it unfolds moment-by-moment and the more standardised,
      institutional demands which are embedded in the EPR ('dilemma of attention'). In 
      this paper I extend this work, presenting an in-depth examination of how
      participants in the consultation manage this tension. I used linguistic
      ethnographic methods to study 54 video recorded consultations from a dataset
      collected between 2007 and 2008 in two UK general practices, combining
      microanalysis of the consultation with ethnographic attention to the wider
      organisational and institutional context. My analysis draws on the theoretical
      work of Erving Goffman and Mikhail Bakhtin, incorporating attention to the 'here 
      and now' of the interaction as well as an appreciation of the 'distributed'
      nature of the EPR, its role in hosting and circulating new voices, and in
      mediating participants' talk and social practices. It reveals - in apparently
      fleeting moments of negotiation and contestation - the extent to which the EPR
      shapes the dynamic construction, display and circulation of authority in the
      contemporary consultation.

TI  - Occupant and crash characteristics in thoracic and lumbar spine injuries
      resulting from motor vehicle collisions.

AB  - BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Motor vehicle collisions (MVC) are a leading cause of
      thoracic and lumbar (T and L) spine injuries. Mechanisms of injury in vehicular
      crashes that result in thoracic and lumbar fractures and the spectrum of injury
      in these occupants have not been extensively studied in the literature. PURPOSE: 
      The objective was to investigate the patterns of T and L spine injuries after
      MVC; correlate these patterns with restraint use, crash characteristics, and
      demographic variables; and study the associations of these injuries with general 
      injury morbidity and fatality. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: The study design is a
      retrospective study of a prospectively gathered database. PATIENT SAMPLE: Six
      hundred thirty-one occupants with T and L (T1-L5) spine injuries from 4,572
      occupants included in the Crash Injury Research and Engineering Network (CIREN)
      database between 1996 and 2011 were included in this study. OUTCOME MEASURES: No 
      clinical outcome measures were evaluated in this study. METHODS: The CIREN
      database includes moderate to severely injured occupants from MVC involving
      vehicles manufactured recently. Demographic, injury, and crash data from each
      patient were analyzed for correlations between patterns of T and L spine
      injuries, associated extraspinal injuries and overall injury severity score
      (ISS), type and use of seat belts, and other crash characteristics. T and L spine
      injuries patterns were categorized using a modified Denis' classification to
      include extension injuries as a separate entity. RESULTS: T and L spine injuries 
      were identified in 631 of 4,572 vehicle occupants, of whom 299 sustained major
      injuries (including 21 extension injuries) and 332 sustained minor injuries.
      Flexion-distraction injuries were more prevalent in children and young adults and
      extension injuries in older adults (mean age, 65.7 years). Occupants with
      extension injuries had a mean body mass index of 36.0 and a fatality rate of
      23.8%, much higher than the fatality rate for the entire cohort (10.9%). The most
      frequent extraspinal injuries (Abbreviated Injury Scale Grade 2 or more)
      associated with T and L spine injuries involved the chest (seen in 65.6% of 631
      occupants). In contrast to occupants with major T and L spine injuries, those
      with minor T and L spine injuries showed a strikingly greater association with
      pelvic and abdominal injuries. Occupants with minor T and L spine injuries had a 
      higher mean ISS (27.1) than those with major T and L spine injuries (25.6). Among
      occupants wearing a three-point seat belt, 35.3% sustained T and L spine
      injuries, whereas only 11.6% of the unbelted occupants sustained T and L spine
      injuries. Three-point belted individuals were more likely to sustain burst
      fractures, whereas two-point belted occupants sustained flexion-distraction
      injuries most often and unbelted occupants had a predilection for
      fracture-dislocations of the T and L spines. Three-point seat belts were
      protective against neurologic injury, higher ISS, and fatality. CONCLUSIONS: T
      and L spine fracture patterns are influenced by the age of occupant and type and 
      use of seat belts. Despite a reduction in overall injury severity and mortality, 
      seat belt use is associated with an increased incidence of T and L spine
      fractures. Minor T and L spine fractures were associated with an increased
      likelihood of pelvic and abdominal injuries and higher ISSs, demonstrating their 
      importance in predicting overall injury severity. Extension injuries occurred in 
      older obese individuals and were associated with a high fatality rate. Future
      advancements in automobile safety engineering should address the need to reduce T
      and L spine injuries in belted occupants.

AB  - RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Millions of people use online search engines everyday
      to find health-related information and voluntarily share their personal health
      status and behaviors in various Web sites. Thus, data from tracking of online
      information seeker's behavior offer potential opportunities for use in public
      health surveillance and research. Google Trends is a feature of Google which
      allows Internet users to graph the frequency of searches for a single term or
      phrase over time or by geographic region. We used Google Trends to describe
      patterns of information-seeking behavior in the subject of dense breasts and to
      examine their correlation with the passage or introduction of dense breast
      notification legislation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To capture the temporal
      variations of information seeking about dense breasts, the Web search query
      "dense breast" was entered in the Google Trends tool. We then mapped the dates of
      legislative actions regarding dense breasts that received widespread coverage in 
      the lay media to information-seeking trends about dense breasts over time.
      RESULTS: Newsworthy events and legislative actions appear to correlate well with 
      peaks in search volume of "dense breast". Geographic regions with the highest
      search volumes have passed, denied, or are currently considering the dense breast
      legislation. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that any legislative action and 
      respective news coverage correlate with increase in information seeking for
      "dense breast" on Google, suggesting that Google Trends has the potential to
      serve as a data source for policy-relevant research.

TI  - Measuring use of psychotropic drugs in Veterans Affairs community living centers.
PG  - 588-601
LID - 10.4140/TCP.n.2014.588 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To create an electronic reporting tool able to capture psychotropic
      medication use by residents admitted to Veterans Affairs (VA) community living
      centers (CLCs) and to compare data on frequency of use. DESIGN: Retrospective
      analysis using an electronic medical record (EMR) database. SETTING: CLCs within 
      the Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) 21, which encompasses northern
      Nevada, northern California, and Hawaii. PARTICIPANTS: 4,626 nonrespite care
      veterans admitted to a VISN 21 CLC between 2009 and 2012. PROCEDURES: Medication 
      administration data from the EMR database was compiled into a reporting tool.
      Frequencies calculated were used in comparisons against Centers for Medicare &
      Medicaid Services (CMS) data for non-VA long-term care facilities and against
      previous local VA methods. OUTCOME MEASURE: The primary outcome was to develop a 
      tool that would more accurately capture psychotropic drug use within VA CLCs. The
      secondary objectives were to use the tool to compare psychotropic use among VA
      facilities, against CMS data, and among various subgroups. RESULTS: There was a
      statistically significant difference when comparing psychotropic drug use for
      VISN 21 CLCs compared with use reported by CMS for non-VA long-term care
      facilities. CONCLUSIONS: Veterans in CLCs appear to use psychotropics at a
      significantly higher rate than residents in the community setting. Use of a
      real-time reporting tool can improve assessment of psychotropic drug use and
      create more realistic VA monitoring benchmarks.

      electronic medical records].
PG  - 3430-4
AB  - Ischemic stroke is a kind of common and frequently-occurring disease in clinic.
      It has high morbidity and high mortality and high morbidity characteristics. It
      was treated may also use a variety of Chinese and western medicine in the acute
      phase in the large general hospital in clinical practice. According to the
      "modularity theory" from biology, different patients using different drugs, and
      with combination of drugs for the treatment of this disease may have a variety of
      topological structure characteristics. This study proposed in the national 15
      large general hospital electronic medical records of database, the complex
      network constructed by acute ischemic stroke disease using drugs, adopting to the
      complex network analysis and data mining methods to build for different ischemic 
      stroke patients who are many of Chinese and western medicine group modules. These
      modules can be explained structure and function characteristics, and to explore
      the appropriate crowd and evaluate drug group module efficacy and safety in use
      in clinic. It provide direction to optimize the clinical treatment for ischemic
      stroke, provide new method for the research on combination, also provide the
      basis for drug combination of Chinese and western solution into the guide.

TI  - HIPAA for physicians in the information age.
PG  - 425-7
AB  - The increased prominence of electronic health records, email, mobile devices, and
      social media has transformed the health care environment by providing both
      physicians and patients with opportunities for rapid communication and knowledge 
      exchange. However, these technological advances require increased attention to
      patient privacy under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
      (HIPAA). Instant access to large amounts of electronic protected health
      information (PHI) merits the highest standard of network security and HIPAA
      training for all staff members. Physicians are responsible for protecting PHI
      stored on portable devices. Personal, residential, and public wireless
      connections are not certified with HIPAA-compliant Business Associate Agreements 
      and are unsuitablefor PHI. A professional and privacy-oriented approach to
      electronic communication, online activity, and social media is imperative to
      maintaining public trust in physician integrity. As new technologies are
      integrated into health care practice, the assurance of privacy will encourage
      patients to continue to seek medical care.

TI  - Orphan therapies: making best use of postmarket data.
PG  - S745-51
LID - 10.1007/s11606-014-2882-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Postmarket surveillance of the comparative safety and efficacy of
      orphan therapeutics is challenging, particularly when multiple therapeutics are
      licensed for the same orphan indication. To make best use of product-specific
      registry data collected to fulfill regulatory requirements, we propose the
      creation of a distributed electronic health data network among registries. Such a
      network could support sequential statistical analyses designed to detect early
      warnings of excess risks. We use a simulated example to explore the circumstances
      under which a distributed network may prove advantageous. METHODS: We perform
      sample size calculations for sequential and non-sequential statistical studies
      aimed at comparing the incidence of hepatotoxicity following initiation of two
      newly licensed therapies for homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. We
      calculate the sample size savings ratio, or the proportion of sample size saved
      if one conducted a sequential study as compared to a non-sequential study. Then, 
      using models to describe the adoption and utilization of these therapies, we
      simulate when these sample sizes are attainable in calendar years. We then
      calculate the analytic calendar time savings ratio, analogous to the sample size 
      savings ratio. We repeat these analyses for numerous scenarios. KEY RESULTS:
      Sequential analyses detect effect sizes earlier or at the same time as
      non-sequential analyses. The most substantial potential savings occur when the
      market share is more imbalanced (i.e., 90% for therapy A) and the effect size is 
      closest to the null hypothesis. However, due to low exposure prevalence, these
      savings are difficult to realize within the 30-year time frame of this simulation
      for scenarios in which the outcome of interest occurs at or more frequently than 
      one event/100 person-years. CONCLUSIONS: We illustrate a process to assess
      whether sequential statistical analyses of registry data performed via
      distributed networks may prove a worthwhile infrastructure investment for
      pharmacovigilance.

AB  - Urban contexts introduce unique challenges that must be addressed to ensure that 
      areas of high population density can function when disasters occur. The ability
      to generate useful data to guide decision-making is critical in this context.
      Widespread adoption of electronic health record (EHR) systems in recent years has
      created electronic data sources and networks that may play an important role in
      public health surveillance efforts, including in post-disaster situations. The
      Primary Care Information Project (PCIP) at the New York City Department of Health
      and Mental Hygiene has partnered with local clinicians to establish an electronic
      data system, and this network provides infrastructure to support primary care
      surveillance activities in New York City. After Hurricane Sandy, PCIP generated
      several sets of data to contribute to the city's efforts to assess the impact of 
      the storm, including daily connectivity data to establish practice operations,
      data to examine patterns of primary care utilization in severely affected and
      less affected areas, and data on the frequency of respiratory infection diagnosis
      in the primary care setting. Daily patient visit data from three heavily affected
      neighborhoods showed the health department where primary care capacity was most
      affected in the weeks following Sandy. Overall transmission data showed that
      practices in less affected areas were quicker to return to normal reporting
      patterns, while those in more affected areas did not resume normal data
      transmissions for a few months. Rates of bronchitis increased after Sandy
      compared to the two prior years; while this was most likely attributable to a
      more severe flu season, it demonstrates the capacity of primary care networks to 
      pick up on these types of post-emergency trends. Hurricane Sandy was the first
      disaster situation where PCIP was asked to assess public health impact,
      generating information that could contribute to aid and recovery efforts. This
      experience allowed us to explore the strengths and weaknesses of ambulatory EHR
      data in post-disaster settings. Data from ambulatory EHR networks can augment
      existing surveillance streams by providing sentinel population snapshots on
      clinically available indicators in near real time.

AB  - RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To create novel radiology key image software that is
      easy to use for novice users, incorporates elements adapted from social
      networking Web sites, facilitates resident and fellow education, and can serve as
      the engine for departmental sharing of interesting cases and follow-up studies.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using open-source programming languages and software,
      radiology key image software (the key image and case log application, KICLA) was 
      developed. This system uses a lightweight interface with the institutional
      picture archiving and communications systems and enables the storage of key
      images, image series, and cine clips. It was designed to operate with minimal
      disruption to the radiologists' daily workflow. Many features of the user
      interface have been inspired by social networking Web sites, including image
      organization into private or public folders, flexible sharing with other users,
      and integration of departmental teaching files into the system. We also review
      the performance, usage, and acceptance of this novel system. RESULTS: KICLA was
      implemented at our institution and achieved widespread popularity among
      radiologists. A large number of key images have been transmitted to the system
      since it became available. After this early experience period, the most commonly 
      encountered radiologic modalities are represented. A survey distributed to users 
      revealed that most of the respondents found the system easy to use (89%) and fast
      at allowing them to record interesting cases (100%). Hundred percent of
      respondents also stated that they would recommend a system such as KICLA to their
      colleagues. CONCLUSIONS: The system described herein represents a significant
      upgrade to the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine teaching file
      paradigm with efforts made to maximize its ease of use and inclusion of
      characteristics inspired by social networking Web sites that allow the system
      additional functionality such as individual case logging.

      record implementation on hospital communication.

LID - 10.1136/bmjqs-2013-002436 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Increasing attention is being given to the importance of
      communication in the delivery of high-quality healthcare. We sought to determine 
      whether communication improved in a hospital setting following the introduction
      of an electronic medical record (EMR). METHODS: This pre-post cohort design
      enrolled 75 patient-nurse-physician triads prior to the introduction of EMR, and 
      123 triads after the introduction of EMR. Nurses and patients reported whether
      they communicated with the physician that day. Patients, nurses and physicians
      answered several questions about the plan of care for the day. Responses were
      scored for degree of agreement and compared between pre-EMR and post-EMR cohorts.
      The primary outcome was Total Agreement Score, calculated as the sum of the
      agreement responses. Chart review was performed to determine patients' actual
      length of stay. RESULTS: Although there was no difference between the frequency
      of nurses reporting communication with physicians before and after EMR,
      face-to-face communication was significantly reduced (67% vs 51%, p=0.03). Total 
      Agreement Score was significantly lower after the implementation of EMR (p=0.03).
      Additionally, fewer patients accurately predicted their expected length of stay
      after EMR (34% vs 26%, p=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of EMR was
      associated with a decrease in face-to-face communication between physicians and
      nurses, and worsened overall agreement about the plan of care.

AB  - Ensuring high linkage quality is important in many record linkage applications.
      Current methods for ensuring quality are manual and resource intensive. This
      paper seeks to determine the effectiveness of graph theory techniques in
      identifying record linkage errors. A range of graph theory techniques was applied
      to two linked datasets, with known truth sets. The ability of graph theory
      techniques to identify groups containing errors was compared to a widely used
      threshold setting technique. This methodology shows promise; however, further
      investigations into graph theory techniques are required. The development of more
      efficient and effective methods of improving linkage quality will result in
      higher quality datasets that can be delivered to researchers in shorter
      timeframes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Few data on patterns of care and outcomes are available for elderly
      patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) outside of clinical trials.
      METHODS: We identified patients with DLBCL older than 60 years from a regional
      cancer registry between 2000 and 2010. Based on registry data and chart review,
      128 patients from the oncology network of Eastern Switzerland were analysed for
      patient characteristics, treatment and outcomes of DLBCL. Three age groups were
      compared: 60-69, 70-79 and over 80 years old. RESULTS: Median age was 73 years
      (range: 60 to 95 years). 52/121 treated patients received 6 cycles of
      R-CHOP/CHOP, of those 30 (58%), 18 (35%) and 4 (7%) patients were 60-69 years,
      70-79 years or older than 80 years respectively, with a significant difference by
      age group, p=0.001. Median OS of patients 60-69, 70-79, and 80 years and older
      receiving 6 cycles of R-CHOP/CHOP were: 54 months, 31 months and 24 months
      respectively. In comparison, patients receiving other than 6 cycles of
      R-CHOP/CHOP treatment regimens had a median OS of 22 months, 17 months and 6
      months, respectively. In the multivariable analysis other than 6 cycles of
      R-CHOP/CHOP were significantly associated with poor survival. The risk of dying
      increased by a mean of 6% for each year of age from age 60 years onwards.
      CONCLUSION: In conclusion, treatment regimens other than 6 cycles of R-CHOP/CHOP 
      were significant predictors for survival in our oncology network. The possibility
      of using R-CHOP treatment regimen should be seriously considered in elderly
      patients with DLBCL.

AB  - The New York City Clinical Data Research Network (NYC-CDRN), funded by the
      Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI), brings together 22
      organizations including seven independent health systems to enable
      patient-centered clinical research, support a national network, and facilitate
      learning healthcare systems. The NYC-CDRN includes a robust, collaborative
      governance and organizational infrastructure, which takes advantage of its
      participants' experience, expertise, and history of collaboration. The technical 
      design will employ an information model to document and manage the collection and
      transformation of clinical data, local institutional staging areas to transform
      and validate data, a centralized data processing facility to aggregate and share 
      data, and use of common standards and tools. We strive to ensure that our project
      is patient-centered; nurtures collaboration among all stakeholders; develops
      scalable solutions facilitating growth and connections; chooses simple, elegant
      solutions wherever possible; and explores ways to streamline the administrative
      and regulatory approval process across sites.

TI  - Louisiana Clinical Data Research Network: establishing an infrastructure for
      efficient conduct of clinical research.
PG  - 612-4
LID - 10.1136/amiajnl-2014-002740 [doi]
AB  - The state of Louisiana, like the nation as a whole, is facing the salient
      challenge of improving population health and efficiency of healthcare delivery.
      Research to inform innovations in healthcare will best enhance this effort if it 
      is timely, efficient, and patient-centered. The Louisiana Clinical Data Research 
      Network (LACDRN) will increase the capacity to conduct robust comparative
      effectiveness research by building a health information technology infrastructure
      that provides access to comprehensive clinical data for more than 1 million
      patients statewide. To ensure that network-based research best serves its
      end-users, the project will actively engage patients and providers as key
      informants and decision-makers in the implementation of LACDRN. The network's
      patient-centered research agenda will prioritize patients' and clinicians' needs 
      and aim to support evidence-based decisions on the healthcare they receive and
      provide, to optimize patient outcomes and quality of life.

TI  - How outcomes are achieved through patient portals: a realist review.
PG  - 751-7
LID - 10.1136/amiajnl-2013-002501 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine how patient portals contribute to health service delivery
      and patient outcomes. The specific aims were to examine how outcomes are
      produced, and how variations in outcomes can be explained. METHODS: We used a
      realist review method, which aims to describe how 'an intervention works, for
      whom, and in what circumstances' by analyzing patterns between context,
      mechanism, and outcomes. We reviewed 32 evaluation studies of patient portals
      published since 2003. RESULTS: The reviewed evaluations indicate that as a
      complement to existing health services, patient portals can lead to improvements 
      in clinical outcomes, patient behavior, and experiences. Four different
      mechanisms are reported to yield the reported outcome improvements. These are
      patient insight into personal health information, activation of information,
      interpersonal continuity of care, and service convenience. The vast majority of
      evaluations were conducted in integrated health service networks in the USA, and 
      we detected no substantial variation in outcomes across these networks.
      DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Patient portals may impact clinical outcomes and
      health service delivery through multiple mechanisms. Given the relative
      uniformity of evaluation contexts, we were not able to detect patterns in how
      patient portals work in different contexts. Nonetheless, it appears from the
      overwhelming proportion of patient portal evaluations coming from integrated
      health service networks, that these networks provide more fertile contexts for
      patient portals to be effective. To improve the understanding of how patient
      portals work, future evaluations of patient portals should capture information
      about mechanisms and context that influence their outcomes.

      prostatectomy.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Variation in care within and across geographic areas remains poorly
      understood. The goal of this article was to examine whether physician social
      networks-as defined by shared patients-are associated with rates of complications
      after radical prostatectomy. METHODS: In five cities, we constructed networks of 
      physicians on the basis of their shared patients in 2004-2005 Surveillance,
      Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare data. From these networks, we identified
      subgroups of urologists who most frequently shared patients with one another.
      Among men with localized prostate cancer who underwent radical prostatectomy, we 
      used multilevel analysis with generalized linear mixed-effect models to examine
      whether physician network structure-along with specific characteristics of the
      network subgroups-was associated with rates of 30-day and late urinary
      complications, and long-term incontinence after accounting for patient-level
      sociodemographic, clinical factors, and urologist patient volume. RESULTS:
      Networks included 2677 men in five cities who underwent radical prostatectomy.
      The unadjusted rate of 30-day surgical complications varied across network
      subgroups from an 18.8 percentage-point difference in the rate of complications
      across network subgroups in city 1 to a 26.9 percentage-point difference in city 
      5. Large differences in unadjusted rates of late urinary complications and
      long-term incontinence across subgroups were similarly found. Network subgroup
      characteristics-average urologist centrality and patient racial composition-were 
      significantly associated with rates of surgical complications. CONCLUSIONS:
      Analysis of physician networks using Surveillance, Epidemiology and End
      Results-Medicare data provides insight into observed variation in rates of
      complications for localized prostate cancer. If validated, such approaches may be
      used to target future quality improvement interventions.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network (CPCSSN) is a 
      large, validated national primary care Electronic Medical Records (EMR)-based
      database. Our objective was to describe the epidemiology of diabetes in this
      Canadian sample. METHODS: We analyzed the records of 272 469 patients10 years of 
      age and older, with at least 1 primary care clinical encounter between January 1,
      2011, and December 31, 2012. We calculated the age-gender standardized prevalence
      of diabetes. We compared health care utilization and comorbidities for 7 selected
      chronic conditions in patients with and without diabetes. We also examined
      patterns of medication usage. RESULTS: The estimated population prevalence of
      diabetes was 7.6%. Specifically, we studied 25 425 people with diabetes who had
      at least 1 primary care encounter in 2 years. On average, patients with diabetes 
      had 1.42 times as many practice encounters as patients without diabetes (95% CI
      1.42 to 1.43, p<0.0001). Patients with diabetes had 1.29 times as many other
      comorbid conditions as those without diabetes (95% CI 1.27 to 1.31, p<0.0001). We
      found that 85.2% of patients taking hypoglycemic medications were taking
      metformin, and 51.8% were taking 2 or more classes of medications. CONCLUSIONS:
      This study is the first national Canadian report describing the epidemiology of
      diabetes using primary care EMR-based data. We found significantly higher rates
      of primary care use, and greater numbers of comorbidities in patients with
      diabetes. Most patients were on first-line hypoglycemic medications. Data
      routinely recorded in EMRs can be used for surveillance of chronic diseases such 
      as diabetes in Canada. These results can enable comparisons with other national
      EMR-based datasets.

TI  - Components of traumatic brain injury severity indices.
PG  - 1000-7
LID - 10.1089/neu.2013.3145 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine whether there are underlying
      dimensions common among traditional traumatic brain injury (TBI) severity indices
      and, if so, the extent to which they are interchangeable when predicting
      short-term outcomes. This study had an observational design, and took place in
      United States trauma centers reporting to the National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB).
      The sample consisted of 77,470 unweighted adult cases reported to the NTDB from
      2007 to 2010, with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision,
      Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) TBI codes. There were no interventions. Severity
      indices used were the Emergency Department Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) Total score
      and each of the subscales for eye opening (four levels), verbal response (five
      levels), and motor response (six levels); the worst Abbreviated Injury Scale
      (AIS) severity score for the head (six levels); and the worst Barell index type
      (three categories). Prediction models were computed for acute care length of stay
      (days), intensive care unit length of stay (days), hospital discharge status
      (alive or dead), and, if alive, discharge disposition (home versus
      institutional). Multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) indicated a two
      dimensional relationship among items of severity indexes. The primary dimension
      reflected overall injury severity. The second dimension seemed to capture
      volitional behavior without the capability for cogent responding. Together, they 
      defined two vectors around which most of the items clustered. A scale that took
      advantage of the order of items along these vectors proved to be the most
      consistent index for predicting short-term health outcomes. MCA provided useful
      insight into the relationships among components of traditional TBI severity
      indices. The two vector pattern may reflect the impact of injury on different
      cortical and subcortical networks. Results are discussed in terms of score
      substitution and the ability to impute missing values.

TI  - Content and functional specifications for a standards-based multidisciplinary
      rounding tool to maintain continuity across acute and critical care.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Maintaining continuity of care (CoC) in the inpatient setting is
      dependent on aligning goals and tasks with the plan of care (POC) during
      multidisciplinary rounds (MDRs). A number of locally developed rounding tools
      exist, yet there is a lack of standard content and functional specifications for 
      electronic tools to support MDRs within and across settings. OBJECTIVE: To
      identify content and functional requirements for an MDR tool to support CoC.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: We collected discrete clinical data elements (CDEs)
      discussed during rounds for 128 acute and critical care patients. To capture
      CDEs, we developed and validated an iPad-based observational tool based on
      informatics CoC standards. We observed 19 days of rounds and conducted eight
      group and individual interviews. Descriptive and bivariate statistics and network
      visualization were conducted to understand associations between CDEs discussed
      during rounds with a particular focus on the POC. Qualitative data were
      thematically analyzed. All analyses were triangulated. RESULTS: We identified the
      need for universal and configurable MDR tool views across settings and users and 
      the provision of messaging capability. Eleven empirically derived universal CDEs 
      were identified, including four POC CDEs: problems, plan, goals, and short-term
      concerns. Configurable POC CDEs were: rationale, tasks/'to dos', pending results 
      and procedures, discharge planning, patient preferences, need for urgent review, 
      prognosis, and advice/guidance. DISCUSSION: Some requirements differed between
      settings; yet, there was overlap between POC CDEs. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend an
      initial list of 11 universal CDEs for continuity in MDRs across settings and 27
      CDEs that can be configured to meet setting-specific needs.

TI  - Decision support from local data: creating adaptive order menus from past
      clinician behavior.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Reducing care variability through guidelines has significantly
      benefited patients. Nonetheless, guideline-based Clinical Decision Support (CDS) 
      systems are not widely implemented or used, are frequently out-of-date, and
      cannot address complex care for which guidelines do not exist. Here, we develop
      and evaluate a complementary approach - using Bayesian Network (BN) learning to
      generate adaptive, context-specific treatment menus based on local order-entry
      data. These menus can be used as a draft for expert review, in order to minimize 
      development time for local decision support content. This is in keeping with the 
      vision outlined in the US Health Information Technology Strategic Plan, which
      describes a healthcare system that learns from itself. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We 
      used the Greedy Equivalence Search algorithm to learn four 50-node
      domain-specific BNs from 11,344 encounters: abdominal pain in the emergency
      department, inpatient pregnancy, hypertension in the Urgent Visit Clinic, and
      altered mental state in the intensive care unit. We developed a system to produce
      situation-specific, rank-ordered treatment menus from these networks. We
      evaluated this system with a hospital-simulation methodology and computed Area
      Under the Receiver-Operator Curve (AUC) and average menu position at time of
      selection. We also compared this system with a similar association-rule-mining
      approach. RESULTS: A short order menu on average contained the next order
      (weighted average length 3.91-5.83 items). Overall predictive ability was good:
      average AUC above 0.9 for 25% of order types and overall average AUC .714-.844
      (depending on domain). However, AUC had high variance (.50-.99). Higher AUC
      correlated with tighter clusters and more connections in the graphs, indicating
      importance of appropriate contextual data. Comparison with an Association Rule
      Mining approach showed similar performance for only the most common orders with
      dramatic divergence as orders are less frequent. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: This 
      study demonstrates that local clinical knowledge can be extracted from treatment 
      data for decision support. This approach is appealing because: it reflects local 
      standards; it uses data already being captured; and it produces human-readable
      treatment-diagnosis networks that could be curated by a human expert to reduce
      workload in developing localized CDS content. The BN methodology captured
      transitive associations and co-varying relationships, which existing approaches
      do not. It also performs better as orders become less frequent and require more
      context. This system is a step forward in harnessing local, empirical data to
      enhance decision support.

TI  - A medical application integrating remote 3D visualization tools to access picture
      archiving and communication system on mobile devices.

AB  - With computing capability and display size growing, the mobile device has been
      used as a tool to help clinicians view patient information and medical images
      anywhere and anytime. However, for direct interactive 3D visualization, which
      plays an important role in radiological diagnosis, the mobile device cannot
      provide a satisfactory quality of experience for radiologists. This paper
      developed a medical system that can get medical images from the picture archiving
      and communication system on the mobile device over the wireless network. In the
      proposed application, the mobile device got patient information and medical
      images through a proxy server connecting to the PACS server. Meanwhile, the proxy
      server integrated a range of 3D visualization techniques, including maximum
      intensity projection, multi-planar reconstruction and direct volume rendering, to
      providing shape, brightness, depth and location information generated from the
      original sectional images for radiologists. Furthermore, an algorithm that
      changes remote render parameters automatically to adapt to the network status was
      employed to improve the quality of experience. Finally, performance issues
      regarding the remote 3D visualization of the medical images over the wireless
      network of the proposed application were also discussed. The results demonstrated
      that this proposed medical application could provide a smooth interactive
      experience in the WLAN and 3G networks.

TI  - Efficient sequential and parallel algorithms for record linkage.
PG  - 252-62
LID - 10.1136/amiajnl-2013-002034 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Integrating data from multiple sources is a crucial and
      challenging problem. Even though there exist numerous algorithms for record
      linkage or deduplication, they suffer from either large time needs or
      restrictions on the number of datasets that they can integrate. In this paper we 
      report efficient sequential and parallel algorithms for record linkage which
      handle any number of datasets and outperform previous algorithms. METHODS: Our
      algorithms employ hierarchical clustering algorithms as the basis. A key idea
      that we use is radix sorting on certain attributes to eliminate identical records
      before any further processing. Another novel idea is to form a graph that links
      similar records and find the connected components. RESULTS: Our sequential and
      parallel algorithms have been tested on a real dataset of 1,083,878 records and
      synthetic datasets ranging in size from 50,000 to 9,000,000 records. Our
      sequential algorithm runs at least two times faster, for any dataset, than the
      previous best-known algorithm, the two-phase algorithm using faster computation
      of the edit distance (TPA (FCED)). The speedups obtained by our parallel
      algorithm are almost linear. For example, we get a speedup of 7.5 with 8 cores
      (residing in a single node), 14.1 with 16 cores (residing in two nodes), and 26.4
      with 32 cores (residing in four nodes). CONCLUSIONS: We have compared the
      performance of our sequential algorithm with TPA (FCED) and found that our
      algorithm outperforms the previous one. The accuracy is the same as that of this 
      previous best-known algorithm.

TI  - Consistency of racial variation in medical outcomes among publicly and privately 
      insured living kidney donors.
PG  - 316-24
LID - 10.1097/01.TP.0000436731.23554.5e [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Racial disparities in health outcomes after living donation have been
      reported, but generalizability is not known. METHODS: We linked Organ Procurement
      and Transplantation Network (OPTN) registry data for 4,007 living kidney donors
      in 1987 to 2008 with Medicare billing claims (2000-2008). Cox regression with
      left and right censoring was used to estimate the frequencies and relative risks 
      of postdonation medical diagnoses according to race. Patterns were compared with 
      findings from a previous linkage of OPTN donor records and private insurance
      claims. RESULTS: Among the Medicare-insured donors, 8% were African American and 
      5.7% were Hispanic. Diagnosis frequencies at 5 years after donation in the
      Medicare- versus privately insured donors included the following: malignant
      hypertension, 5.0% versus 0.9%; diabetes, 18.5% versus 4.1%; and chronic kidney
      disease, 21.8% versus 4.9%. After age and sex adjustment in the Medicare sample, 
      African Americans, as compared with white donors, experienced higher risks of any
      hypertension diagnosis, including 2.4 times the likelihood of malignant
      hypertension (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 2.35; 95% confidence interval [CI],
      1.40-3.93), and more common diabetes (aHR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.12-2.04), chronic
      kidney disease (aHR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.37-2.47), and proteinuria (aHR, 2.44; 95%
      CI, 1.45-4.11) diagnoses. Relative patterns for privately insured African
      American versus white donors were similar, including approximately three times
      the risk of malignant hypertension (aHR, 3.27; 95% CI, 1.82-5.88) and twice the
      relative risks of chronic kidney disease and proteinuria. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent
      demonstration of racial variation in postdonation medical conditions regardless
      of sample/payer source supports the need for continued study of mediators and
      consequences of outcomes in non-white donors.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate a commercially available ambulatory electronic health
      record's (EHR's) impact on workflow and financial measures. DATA SOURCES/STUDY
      SETTING: Administrative, payroll, and billing data were collected for 26 primary 
      care practices in a fee-for-service network that rolled out an EHR on a staggered
      schedule from June 2006 through December 2008. STUDY DESIGN: An interrupted time 
      series design was used. Staffing, visit intensity, productivity, volume, practice
      expense, payments received, and net income data were collected monthly for
      2004-2009. Changes were evaluated 1-6, 7-12, and >12 months postimplementation.
      DATA COLLECTION/EXTRACTION METHODS: Data were accessed through a SQLserver
      database, transformed into SAS(R), and aggregated by practice. Practice-level
      data were divided by full-time physician equivalents for comparisons across
      practices by month. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Staffing and practice expenses increased 
      following EHR implementation (3 and 6 percent after 12 months). Productivity,
      volume, and net income decreased initially but recovered to/close to
      preimplementation levels after 12 months. Visit intensity did not change
      significantly, and a secular trend offset the decrease in payments received.
      CONCLUSIONS: Expenses increased and productivity decreased following EHR
      implementation, but not as much or as persistently as might be expected. Longer
      term effects still need to be examined.

TI  - [Rehabilitation of severely injured patients in acute care hospitals: who is
      doing what? A nationwide survey in the Trauma Network DGU].
PG  - 25-30
LID - 10.1055/s-0033-1341458 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: During the treatment of severely injured patients, rehabilitation
      takes an important role. In this study we examined the present structures in
      acute care hospitals, which influence the process of rehabiliation. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: The data was captured in a questionnaire. The questions deal with the
      personal and structural situation of acute care hospitals in Germany. The
      questionnaires were sent to all clinics, which are registered in the
      TraumaNetwork DGU. RESULTS: 424 hospitals answered the questionnaire. This is a
      response rate of 57.3% regarding 740 acitve clinics in the TraumaNetwork DGU. 58%
      have no opportunity for rehabilitation. The majority of the hospitals have a
      physiotherapy, (98.6%) or an occupational therapy (71.0%); 33.3% have a case
      management. Only 17.0% of the hospitals have rehabilitation teams which take care
      during the hospital stay. These teams consist mainly of internal rehabilitation
      physicians and physical therapists. Supraregional Trauma Center have better
      organized structures, as hospitals with lower level of care. Only 56.6% of all
      hospitals reported that they were familiar with the cooperating rehabilitation
      hospitals. There are special cooperations with rehabilita-tion hospitals in 34.4%
      of all cases. CONCLUSION: The early mobilisation of severely injured patients is 
      an integral part of the postoperative course in German hospitals. While on the
      one hand a large number of hospitals have good structural conditions on the other
      hand these structures are little integrated in the daily treamtment. There are
      major gaps and uncertainties in the cooperation between acute care clincs and
      rehabilitation hospitals. The integra-tion of rehabilitation hospitals in the
      TraumaNetwork DGU could be a good chance to improve this collaboration.

TI  - Clinical and Demographic Factors Associated With Receipt of Non
      Guideline-concordant Initial Therapy for Nonmetastatic Prostate Cancer.
AB  - OBJECTIVES:: To determine the extent to which initial therapy for nonmetastatic
      prostate cancer was concordant with nationally recognized guidelines using
      supplemented cancer registry data and what factors were associated with receipt
      of nonguideline-concordant care. METHODS:: Initial therapy for 8229 nonmetastatic
      prostate cancer cases diagnosed in 2004 from cancer registries in 7 states was
      abstracted as part of the Centers for Disease Control's Patterns of Care Breast
      and Prostate Cancer study conducted during 2007 to 2009. The National
      Comprehensive Cancer Network clinical practice guidelines version 1.2002 was used
      as the standard of care based on recurrence risk group and life expectancy (LE). 
      A multivariable model was used to determine risk factors associated with receipt 
      of nonguideline-concordant care. RESULTS:: Nearly 80% with nonmetastatic prostate
      cancer received guideline-concordant care for initial therapy. Receipt of
      nonguideline-concordant care (including receiving either less aggressive therapy 
      or more aggressive therapy than indicated) was related to older age, African
      American race/ethnicity, being unmarried, rural residence, and especially to
      being in the high recurrence risk group where receiving less aggressive therapy
      than indicated occurred more often than receiving more aggressive therapy
      (adjusted OR=4.2; 95% CL, 3.5-5.2 vs. low-risk group). Compared with life table
      estimates adjusted for comorbidity, physicians tended to underestimate LE.
      CONCLUSIONS:: Receipt of less aggressive therapy than indicated among high-risk
      group men with >5-year LE based on life table estimates adjusted for comorbidity 
      was a concern. Physicians may tend to underestimate 5-year survival among this
      group and should be alerted to the importance of recommending aggressive therapy 
      when warranted. However, based on more recent guidelines, among those with
      low-risk disease, the proportion considered to be receiving less aggressive
      therapy than indicated may now be lower because active surveillance is now
      considered appropriate.

      through home telemonitoring of symptoms.
PG  - 3825-32
LID - 10.3233/BME-141212 [doi]
AB  - Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a progressive disease of the lung
      with a great prevalence and a remarkable socio-economic impact on patients and
      health systems. Early detection of exacerbations could diminish the adverse
      effects on patients' health and cut down costs burdened on patients with COPD. A 
      group of 16 patients were telemonitored at home using a novel electronic daily
      symptoms questionnaire during a 6-months field trial. Recorded data were used to 
      train and validate a Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) classifier in order to
      enable the automatic prediction of exacerbations. The proposed system was able to
      predict COPD exacerbations early with a margin of 4.8 +/- 1.8 days (average +/-
      SD). Detection accuracy was 80.5% (33 out of 41 exacerbations were early
      detected); 78.8% (26 out of 33) of theses detected events were reported
      exacerbation and 87.5% (7 out of 8) were unreported episodes. The proposed
      questionnaire and the designed automatic classifier could support the early
      detection of COPD exacerbations of benefit to both physicians and patients.

AB  - Combining samples across multiple cohorts in large-scale scientific research
      programs is often required to achieve the necessary power for genome-wide
      association studies. Controlling for genomic ancestry through principal component
      analysis (PCA) to address the effect of population stratification is a common
      practice. In addition to local genomic variation, such as copy number variation
      and inversions, other factors directly related to combining multiple studies,
      such as platform and site recruitment bias, can drive the correlation patterns in
      PCA. In this report, we describe the combination and analysis of multi-ethnic
      cohort with biobanks linked to electronic health records for large-scale genomic 
      association discovery analyses. First, we outline the observed site and platform 
      bias, in addition to ancestry differences. Second, we outline a general protocol 
      for selecting variants for input into the subject variance-covariance matrix, the
      conventional PCA approach. Finally, we introduce an alternative approach to PCA
      by deriving components from subject loadings calculated from a reference sample. 
      This alternative approach of generating principal components controlled for site 
      and platform bias, in addition to ancestry differences, has the advantage of
      fewer covariates and degrees of freedom.

AB  - There are many technology platforms that bring benefits only when users share
      data. In healthcare, this is a key policy issue, because of the potential cost
      savings and quality improvements from 'big data' in the form of sharing
      electronic patient data across medical providers. Indeed, one criterion used for 
      federal subsidies for healthcare information technology is whether the software
      has the capability to share data. We find empirically that larger hospital
      systems are more likely to exchange electronic patient information internally,
      but are less likely to exchange patient information externally with other
      hospitals. This pattern is driven by instances where there may be a commercial
      cost to sharing data with other hospitals. Our results suggest that the common
      strategy of using 'marquee' large users to kick-start a platform technology has
      an important drawback of potentially creating information silos. This suggests
      that federal subsidies for health data technologies based on 'meaningful use'
      criteria, that are based simply on the capability to share data rather than
      actual sharing of data, may be misplaced.

TI  - A qualitative study of rural primary care clinician views on remote monitoring
      technologies.
PG  - 69-78
LID - 10.1111/jrh.12027 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Remote monitoring technologies (RMTs) may improve the quality of care,
      reduce access barriers, and help control medical costs. Despite the role of
      primary care clinicians as potential key users of RMTs, few studies explore their
      views. This study explores rural primary care clinician interest and the
      resources necessary to incorporate RMTs into routine practice. METHODS: We
      conducted 15 in-depth interviews with rural primary care clinician members of the
      Oregon Rural Practice-based Research Network (ORPRN) from November 2011 to April 
      2012. Our multidisciplinary team used thematic analysis to identify emergent
      themes and a cross-case comparative analysis to explore variation by participant 
      and practice characteristics. RESULTS: Clinicians expressed interest in RMTs most
      relevant to their clinical practice, such as supporting chronic disease
      management, noting benefits to patients of all ages. They expressed concern about
      the quantity of data, patient motivation to utilize equipment, and potential
      changes to the patient-clinician encounter. Direct data transfer into the
      clinic's electronic health record (EHR), availability in multiple formats, and
      review by ancillary staff could facilitate implementation. Although participants 
      acknowledged the potential system-level benefits of using RMTs, adoption would be
      difficult without payment reform. CONCLUSIONS: Adoption of RMTs by rural primary 
      care clinicians may be influenced by equipment purpose and functionality,
      implementation resources, and payment. Clinician and staff engagement will be
      critical to actualize RMT use in routine primary care.

AB  - CLINICAL/METHODICAL ISSUE: Reporting in radiology faces considerable changes in
      the near future that will be influenced by a broader understanding of the task
      and increasing technological possibilities. STANDARD RADIOLOGICAL METHODS: Until 
      now a radiological report could be regarded as a text phrased by a radiologist
      after viewing imaging data. METHODICAL INNOVATIONS: New solutions will be
      accessed by advances in visualization of large datasets, in extracting,
      analyzing, and communicating metadata as well as by improved integration and
      interpretation of clinical information. PERFORMANCE: Virtual reality, texture
      analysis, growing networks, semantic annotation, data mining and context based
      presentation have the potential to extensively change the everyday working
      routine. ACHIEVEMENTS: Although many of these developments are still in a
      laboratory phase, the impact on the process of reporting can already be
      predicted. PRACTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS: As the leading community in information
      analysis and technology, radiology as a subject should strive to lead and shape
      these impending changes.

TI  - Novel algorithms for improved pattern recognition using the US FDA Adverse Event 
      Network Analyzer.
PG  - 1178-82
AB  - The medical review of adverse event reports for medical products requires the
      processing of "big data" stored in spontaneous reporting systems, such as the US 
      Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). VAERS data are not well suited to
      traditional statistical analyses so we developed the FDA Adverse Event Network
      Analyzer (AENA) and three novel network analysis approaches to extract
      information from these data. Our new approaches include a weighting scheme based 
      on co-occurring triplets in reports, a visualization layout inspired by the
      islands algorithm, and a network growth methodology for the detection of
      outliers. We explored and verified these approaches by analysing the historical
      signal of Intussusception (IS) after the administration of RotaShield vaccine
      (RV) in 1999. We believe that our study supports the use of AENA for pattern
      recognition in medical product safety and other clinical data.

TI  - Motor vehicle crash-related injury causation scenarios for spinal injuries in
      restrained children and adolescents.
PG  - S49-55
LID - 10.1080/15389588.2014.934959 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Motor vehicle crash (MVC)-related spinal injuries result in
      significant morbidity and mortality in children. The objective was to identify
      MVC-related injury causation scenarios for spinal injuries in restrained
      children. METHODS: This was a case series of occupants in MVCs from the Crash
      Injury Research and Engineering Network (CIREN) data set. Occupants aged 0-17
      years old with at least one Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) 2+ severity spinal
      injury in vehicles model year 1990+ that did not experience a rollover were
      included. Unrestrained occupants, those not using the shoulder portion of the
      belt restraint, and those with child restraint gross misuse were excluded.
      Occupants with preexisting comorbidities contributing to spinal injury and
      occupants with limited injury information were also excluded. A multidisciplinary
      team retrospectively reviewed each case to determine injury causation scenarios
      (ICSs). Crash conditions, occupant and restraint characteristics, and injuries
      were qualitatively summarized. RESULTS: Fifty-nine cases met the study inclusion 
      criteria and 17 were excluded. The 42 occupants included sustained 97 distinct
      AIS 2+ spinal injuries (27 cervical, 22 thoracic, and 48 lumbar; 80 AIS-2, 15
      AIS-3, 1 AIS-5, and 1 AIS-6), with fracture as the most common injury type (80%).
      Spinal-injured occupants were most frequently in passenger cars (64%), and crash 
      direction was most often frontal (62%). Mean delta-V was 51.3 km/h+/-19.4 km/h.
      The average occupant age was 12.4+/-5.3 years old, and 48% were 16- to
      17-year-olds. Thirty-six percent were right front passengers and 26% were
      drivers. Most occupants were lap and shoulder belt restrained (88%). Non-spinal
      AIS 2+ injuries included those of the lower extremity and pelvis (n=56), head
      (n=43), abdomen (n=39), and thorax (n=36). Spinal injury causation was typically 
      due to flexion or lateral bending over the lap and or shoulder belt or child
      restraint harness, compression by occupant's own seat back, or axial loading
      through the seat pan. Nearly all injuries in children<12 years occurred by
      flexion over a restraint, whereas teenage passengers had flexion, direct contact,
      and other ICS mechanisms. All of the occupants with frontal flexion mechanism had
      injuries to the lumbar spine, and most (78%) had associated hollow or solid organ
      abdominal injuries. CONCLUSIONS: Restrained children in nonrollover MVCs with
      spinal injuries in the CIREN database are most frequently in high-speed frontal
      crashes, of teenage age, and have vertebral fractures. There are age-specific
      mechanism patterns that should be further explored. Because even moderate spinal 
      trauma can result in measurable morbidity, future efforts should focus on
      mitigating these injuries.

TI  - Information transfer to out-of-hours co-operatives: a survey of general
      practitioners' views in relation to palliative patients.
PG  - 405-11
LID - 10.1136/bmjspcare-2012-000281 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In Ireland, weekend and night medical cover for community based
      patients is largely provided by general practice co-operatives. Doctors working
      in this service do not have direct access to patients' medical records which
      challenges continuity of care. OBJECTIVES: This study investigates the opinion of
      general practitioners (GPs) on the potential value of a formalised method of
      information transfer regarding their palliative patients to out-of-hours GP
      co-operatives. The survey was designed to identify the information that is
      necessary to offer appropriate anticipated end-of-life care. METHODS: A
      questionnaire was sent to all 414 GPs registered in the Irish Medical Directory
      in the southwest of Ireland. Data were analysed with Microsoft Excel and SPSS
      V.12.0. RESULTS: 52% response rate with exclusion of incomplete questionnaires
      allowed analysis of 212 data sets. Currently, 82% of GPs do not routinely
      transfer information pertaining to end-of-life issues to the out-of-hours
      service. Despite this, 96% would value a standardised way of transferring
      information. 67% felt they sometimes refer unnecessarily to hospital emergency
      departments due to lack of information. The most important items of information
      identified by study participants are as follows: black triangle right Diagnosis
      (97%) black triangle right Medications (94%) black triangle right Patient insight
      (91%) black triangle right Patient wishes regarding end-of-life care (90%) black 
      triangle right Anticipated problems and suggested management(90%). CONCLUSIONS: A
      structured format for information transfer regarding end-of-life care is deemed
      important by GPs when working on-call at night and weekends. Diagnosis, patient
      preference and management plans are valued.

PG  - e232-8
LID - 10.1136/amiajnl-2013-001932 [doi]
AB  - The burgeoning adoption of electronic health records (EHR) introduces a golden
      opportunity for studying individual manifestations of myriad diseases, which is
      called 'EHR phenotyping'. In this paper, we break down this concept by: relating 
      it to phenotype definitions from Johannsen; comparing it to cohort identification
      and disease subtyping; introducing a new concept called 'verotype' (Latin: vere =
      true, actually) to represent the 'true' population of similar patients for
      treatment purposes through the integration of genotype, phenotype, and disease
      subtype (eg, specific glucose value pattern in patients with diabetes)
      information; analyzing the value of the 'verotype' concept for personalized
      medicine; and outlining the potential for using network-based approaches to
      reverse engineer clinical disease subtypes.

TI  - Identifying phenotypic signatures of neuropsychiatric disorders from electronic
      medical records.
PG  - e297-305
LID - 10.1136/amiajnl-2013-001933 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Mental illness is the leading cause of disability in the USA, but
      boundaries between different mental illnesses are notoriously difficult to
      define. Electronic medical records (EMRs) have recently emerged as a powerful new
      source of information for defining the phenotypic signatures of specific
      diseases. We investigated how EMR-based text mining and statistical analysis
      could elucidate the phenotypic boundaries of three important neuropsychiatric
      illnesses-autism, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. METHODS: We analyzed the
      medical records of over 7000 patients at two facilities using an automated
      text-processing pipeline to annotate the clinical notes with Unified Medical
      Language System codes and then searching for enriched codes, and associations
      among codes, that were representative of the three disorders. We used
      dimensionality-reduction techniques on individual patient records to understand
      individual-level phenotypic variation within each disorder, as well as the degree
      of overlap among disorders. RESULTS: We demonstrate that automated EMR mining can
      be used to extract relevant drugs and phenotypes associated with neuropsychiatric
      disorders and characteristic patterns of associations among them. Patient-level
      analyses suggest a clear separation between autism and the other disorders, while
      revealing significant overlap between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. They
      also enable localization of individual patients within the phenotypic 'landscape'
      of each disorder. CONCLUSIONS: Because EMRs reflect the realities of patient care
      rather than idealized conceptualizations of disease states, we argue that
      automated EMR mining can help define the boundaries between different mental
      illnesses, facilitate cohort building for clinical and genomic studies, and
      reveal how clear expert-defined disease boundaries are in practice.

AB  - Clinical records include both coded and free-text fields that interact to reflect
      complicated patient stories. The information often covers not only the present
      medical condition and events experienced by the patient, but also refers to
      relevant events in the past (such as signs, symptoms, tests or treatments). In
      order to automatically construct a timeline of these events, we first need to
      extract the temporal relations between pairs of events or time expressions
      presented in the clinical notes. We designed separate extraction components for
      different types of temporal relations, utilizing a novel hybrid system that
      combines machine learning with a graph-based inference mechanism to extract the
      temporal links. The temporal graph is a directed graph based on parse tree
      dependencies of the simplified sentences and frequent pattern clues. We
      generalized the sentences in order to discover patterns that, given the
      complexities of natural language, might not be directly discoverable in the
      original sentences. The proposed hybrid system performance reached an F-measure
      of 0.63, with precision at 0.76 and recall at 0.54 on the 2012 i2b2 Natural
      Language Processing corpus for the temporal relation (TLink) extraction task,
      achieving the highest precision and third highest f-measure among participating
      teams in the TLink track.

TI  - Using electronic health records to conduct children's health insurance
      surveillance.
PG  - e1584-91
LID - 10.1542/peds.2013-1470 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Health insurance options are changing. Electronic health record (EHR) 
      databases present new opportunities for providers to track the insurance coverage
      status of their patients. This study demonstrates the use of EHR data for this
      purpose. METHODS: Using EHR data from the OCHIN Network of community health
      centers, we conducted a retrospective cohort study of data from children
      presenting to a community health center in 2010-2011 (N = 185,959). We described 
      coverage patterns for children, used generalized estimating equation logistic
      regression to compare uninsured children with those with insurance, and assessed 
      insurance status at subsequent visits. RESULTS: At their first visit during the
      study period, 21% of children had no insurance. Among children uninsured at a
      first visit, 30% were uninsured at all subsequent visits. In multivariable
      analyses (including gender, age, race, ethnicity, language, income, location, and
      type of clinic), we observed significant differences in the characteristics of
      children who were uninsured as compared with those with insurance coverage. For
      example, compared with white, non-Hispanic children, nonwhite and/or Hispanic
      children had lower odds of being uninsured than having Medicaid/Medicare
      (adjusted odds ratio, 0.73; 95% confidence interval: 0.71-0.75) but had higher
      odds of being uninsured than having commercial insurance (adjusted odds ratio,
      1.50; 95% confidence interval: 1.44-1.56). CONCLUSIONS: Nearly one-third of
      children uninsured at their first visit remained uninsured at all subsequent
      visits, which suggests a need for clinics to conduct insurance surveillance and
      develop mechanisms to assist patients with obtaining coverage. EHRs can
      facilitate insurance surveillance and inform interventions aimed at helping
      patients obtain and retain coverage.

AB  - PURPOSE: This paper describes proposed health care services innovations, provided
      by a system called CAALYX (Complete Ambient Assisted Living eXperiment). CAALYX
      aimed to provide healthcare innovation by extending the state-of-the-art in
      tele-healthcare, by focusing on increasing the confidence of elderly people
      living autonomously, by building on the knowledge base of the most common
      disorders and respective characteristic vital sign changes for this age group.
      METHODS: A review of the state-of-the-art on health care services was carried
      out. Then, extensive research was conducted on the particular needs of the
      elderly in relation to home health services that, if offered to them, could
      improve their day life by giving them greater confidence and autonomy. To achieve
      this, we addressed issues associated with the gathering of clinical data and
      interpretation of these data, as well as possibilities of automatically
      triggering appropriate clinical measures. Considering this initial work we
      started the identification of initiatives, ongoing works and technologies that
      could be used for the development of the system. After that, the implementation
      of CAALYX was done. FINDINGS: The innovation in CAALYX system considers three
      main areas of contribution: (i) The Roaming Monitoring System that is used to
      collect information on the well-being of the elderly users; (ii) The Home
      Monitoring System that is aimed at helping the elders independently living at
      home being implemented by a device (a personal computer or a set top box) that
      supports the connection of sensors and video cameras that may be used for
      monitoring and for interaction with the elder; (iii) The Central Care Service and
      Monitoring System that is implemented by a Caretaker System where attention and
      care services are provided to elders, where actors as Caretakers, Doctors and
      Relatives are logically linked to elders. Innovations in each of these areas are 
      presented here. CONCLUSIONS: The ageing European society is placing an added
      burden on future generations, as the 'elderly-to-working-age-people' ratio is set
      to steadily increase in the future. Nowadays, quality of life and fitness allows 
      for most older persons to have an active life well into their eighties.
      Furthermore, many older persons prefer to live in their own house and choose
      their own lifestyle. The CAALYX system can have a clear impact in increasing
      older persons' autonomy, by ensuring that they do not need to leave their
      preferred environment in order to be properly monitored and taken care of.

TI  - Replication of the OMOP experiment in Europe: evaluating methods for risk
      identification in electronic health record databases.
PG  - S159-69
LID - 10.1007/s40264-013-0109-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) has just
      completed a large scale empirical evaluation of statistical methods and analysis 
      choices for risks identification in longitudinal observational healthcare data.
      This experiment drew data from four large US health insurance claims databases
      and one US electronic health record (EHR) database, but it is unclear to what
      extend the findings of this study apply to other data sources. OBJECTIVE: To
      replicate the OMOP experiment in six European EHR databases. RESEARCH DESIGN: Six
      databases of the EU-ADR (Exploring and Understanding Adverse Drug Reactions)
      database network participated in this study: Aarhus (Denmark), ARS (Italy),
      HealthSearch (Italy), IPCI (the Netherlands), Pedianet (Italy), and Pharmo (the
      Netherlands). All methods in the OMOP experiment were applied to a collection of 
      165 positive and 234 negative control drug-outcome pairs across four outcomes:
      acute liver injury, acute myocardial infarction, acute kidney injury, and upper
      gastrointestinal bleeding. Area under the receiver operator characteristics curve
      (AUC) was computed per database and for a combination of all six databases using 
      meta-analysis for random effects. We provide expected values of estimation error 
      as well, based on negative controls. RESULTS: Similarly to the US experiment,
      high predictive accuracy was found (AUC >0.8) for some analyses. Self-controlled 
      designs, such as self-controlled case series, IC temporal pattern discovery and
      self-controlled cohort achieved higher performance than other methods, both in
      terms of predictive accuracy and observed bias. CONCLUSIONS: The major findings
      of the recent OMOP experiment were also observed in the European databases.

PG  - e67-73
LID - 10.1097/MLR.0b013e31824def85 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most data regarding medical care for cancer patients in the United
      States comes from Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results-linked Medicare
      analyses of individuals aged 65 years or older and typically excludes Medicare
      Advantage enrollees. OBJECTIVES: To assess the accuracy of chemotherapy and
      hormone therapy treatment data available through the Cancer Research Network's
      Virtual Data Warehouse (VDW). RESEARCH DESIGN: Retrospective, longitudinal cohort
      study. Medical record-abstracted, tumor registry-indicated treatments (gold
      standard) were compared with VDW-indicated treatments derived from health
      maintenance organization pharmacy, electronic medical record, and claim-based
      data systems. SUBJECTS: Enrollees aged 18 years and older diagnosed with incident
      breast, colorectal, lung, or prostate cancer from 2000 through 2007. MEASURES:
      Sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value were computed at 6 and 12
      months after cancer diagnosis. RESULTS: Approximately 45% of all cancer cases
      (total N=23,800) were aged 64 years or younger. Overall chemotherapy
      sensitivity/specificities across the 3 health plans for incident breast,
      colorectal, lung, and prostate cancer cases were 95%/90%, 95%/93%, 93%/93%, and
      85%/77%, respectively. With the exception of prostate cancer cases, overall
      positive predictive value ranged from 86% to 89%. Small variations in
      chemotherapy data accuracy existed due to cancer site and data source, whereas
      greater variation existed in hormone therapy capture across sites. CONCLUSIONS:
      Strong concordance exists between gold standard tumor registry measures of
      chemotherapy receipt and Cancer Research Network VDW data. Health maintenance
      organization VDW data can be used for a variety of studies addressing patterns of
      cancer care and comparative effectiveness research that previously could only be 
      conducted among elderly Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare
      populations.

TI  - Social and self-reflective use of a Web-based personally controlled health
      management system.
PG  - e211
LID - 10.2196/jmir.2682 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Personally controlled health management systems (PCHMSs) contain a
      bundle of features to help patients and consumers manage their health. However,
      it is unclear how consumers actually use a PCHMS in their everyday settings.
      OBJECTIVE: To conduct an empirical analysis of how consumers used the social
      (forum and poll) and self-reflective (diary and personal health record [PHR])
      features of a Web-based PCHMS designed to support their physical and emotional
      well-being. METHODS: A single-group pre/post-test online prospective study was
      conducted to measure use of a Web-based PCHMS for physical and emotional
      well-being needs during a university academic semester. The PCHMS integrated an
      untethered PHR with social forums, polls, a diary, and online messaging links
      with a health service provider. Well-being journeys additionally provided
      information to encourage engagement with clinicians and health services. A total 
      of 1985 students and staff aged 18 and above with access to the Internet were
      recruited online, of which 709 were eligible for analysis. Participants'
      self-reported well-being, health status, health service utilization, and
      help-seeking behaviors were compared using chi-square, McNemar's test, and
      Student's t test. Social networks were constructed to examine the online forum
      communication patterns among consumers and clinicians. RESULTS: The two PCHMS
      features that were used most frequently and considered most useful and engaging
      were the social features (ie, the poll and forum). More than 30% (213/709) of
      participants who sought well-being assistance during the study indicated that
      other people had influenced their decision to seek help (54.4%, 386/709 sought
      assistance for physical well-being; 31.7%, 225/709 for emotional well-being).
      Although the prevalence of using a self-reflective feature (diary or PHR) was not
      as high (diary: 8.6%, 61/709; PHR: 15.0%, 106/709), the proportion of
      participants who visited a health care professional during the study was more
      than 20% greater in the group that did use a self-reflective feature (diary:
      P=.03; PHR: P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: There was variation in the degree to which
      consumers used social and self-reflective PCHMS features but both were
      significantly associated with increased help-seeking behaviors and health service
      utilization. A PCHMS should combine both self-reflective as well as socially
      driven components to most effectively influence consumers' help-seeking
      behaviors.

TI  - Emerging and encouraging trends in e-prescribing adoption among providers and
      pharmacies.
PG  - 760-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to describe the growth in provider
      (physician, nurse practitioner, and physician assistant) adoption of
      e-prescribing and the growth in pharmacies actively accepting e-prescriptions
      using nationally representative data from December 2008 to December 2012.
      Additionally, this study explored e-prescribing adoption variation by urban and
      rural counties. STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive analysis of nationally representative, 
      transactional e-prescribing data. METHODS: Data for this analysis were from
      Surescripts. Surescripts is a leading e-prescription network utilized by a
      majority of all chain, franchise, or independently owned pharmacies in the United
      States routing prescriptions for more than 240 million patients through their
      network. RESULTS: The total number of prescribers, including physicians, nurse
      practitioners, and physician assistants e-prescribing via an electronic health
      record (EHR) on the Surescripts network has increased from 7% to 54%.
      Additionally, the number of pharmacies actively accepting e-prescriptions is 94%.
      These increases in pharmacies actively accepting e-prescriptions and the
      provider's eprescribing mirror the increase in the volume of e-prescriptions sent
      on the Surescripts network. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis shows that the vast
      majority of pharmacies in the United States are able to accept e-prescriptions
      and over half of providers are e-prescribing via an EHR.

TI  - Variations in radiotherapy delivery in England - evidence from the national
      radiotherapy dataset.
PG  - 531-7
LID - 10.1016/j.clon.2013.04.006 [doi]
LID - S0936-6555(13)00199-4 [pii]
AB  - AIMS, MATERIALS AND METHOD: Data in the national radiotherapy dataset for England
      for 2009-2011 is based upon downloads of activity from every linear accelerator
      in the country through its oncology management system linked to the local patient
      administration system to give a full overview of each patient episode. RESULTS:
      An analysis of this dataset shows that there is still a considerable variation in
      radiotherapy activity across the country, with a two-fold variation between the
      most and least active networks. Lower activity is seen in London and the
      southeast compared with the rest of the country, but when the data are split
      between the north and south of the country, no such variation is seen. Activity
      is higher in smaller centres and non-teaching centres. About half of all
      treatment is palliative and this proportion does not vary with geography,
      although there is considerable variation between individual centres in the
      proportion of radical radiotherapy given. There is a trend towards less use of
      radiotherapy, both radical and palliative, in the more deprived population
      groups, although no change in the relative use of palliative and radical
      treatment. CONCLUSION: It is important to emphasise that these data currently
      reflect activity patterns only and do not reflect quality of care or treatment
      outcomes, which will be achieved by linkage with cancer registry data in the
      future.

TI  - An end-to-end system to identify temporal relation in discharge summaries: 2012
      i2b2 challenge.
PG  - 849-58
LID - 10.1136/amiajnl-2012-001607 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To create an end-to-end system to identify temporal relation in
      discharge summaries for the 2012 i2b2 challenge. The challenge includes event
      extraction, timex extraction, and temporal relation identification. DESIGN: An
      end-to-end temporal relation system was developed. It includes three subsystems: 
      an event extraction system (conditional random fields (CRF) name entity
      extraction and their corresponding attribute classifiers), a temporal extraction 
      system (CRF name entity extraction, their corresponding attribute classifiers,
      and context-free grammar based normalization system), and a temporal relation
      system (10 multi-support vector machine (SVM) classifiers and a Markov logic
      networks inference system) using labeled sequential pattern mining, syntactic
      structures based on parse trees, and results from a coordination classifier.
      Micro-averaged precision (P), recall (R), averaged P&R (P&R), and F measure (F)
      were used to evaluate results. RESULTS: For event extraction, the system achieved
      0.9415 (P), 0.8930 (R), 0.9166 (P&R), and 0.9166 (F). The accuracies of their
      type, polarity, and modality were 0.8574, 0.8585, and 0.8560, respectively. For
      timex extraction, the system achieved 0.8818, 0.9489, 0.9141, and 0.9141,
      respectively. The accuracies of their type, value, and modifier were 0.8929,
      0.7170, and 0.8907, respectively. For temporal relation, the system achieved
      0.6589, 0.7129, 0.6767, and 0.6849, respectively. For end-to-end temporal
      relation, it achieved 0.5904, 0.5944, 0.5921, and 0.5924, respectively. With the 
      F measure used for evaluation, we were ranked first out of 14 competing teams
      (event extraction), first out of 14 teams (timex extraction), third out of 12
      teams (temporal relation), and second out of seven teams (end-to-end temporal
      relation). CONCLUSIONS: The system achieved encouraging results, demonstrating
      the feasibility of the tasks defined by the i2b2 organizers. The experiment
      result demonstrates that both global and local information is useful in the 2012 
      challenge.

TI  - Challenges of using primary care electronic medical records in the UK to study
      medications in pregnancy.
PG  - 977-85
LID - 10.1002/pds.3472 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This paper aimed to assess the prescription of medications during
      pregnancy by primary care physicians in the UK. METHODS: We identified both
      completed pregnancies and pregnancies losses (ectopic pregnancies, miscarriages, 
      terminations, and stillbirths) in women aged 13-49 years enrolled in The Health
      Improvement Network (THIN) between 1996 and 2010 following an algorithm with
      three sequential cycles that searched for Read Code groups in hierarchical order:
      (1) indicators of conception; (2) delivery or pregnancy loss; and (3) other codes
      suggestive of pregnancy. Completed pregnancies were linked to liveborn infants by
      means of the family identification number and date of birth. Prescription of
      specific drugs during the first trimester and time trends during the last decade 
      were calculated. RESULTS: A total of 191 000 pregnancies were identified,
      including 148 544 completed pregnancies and 42 456 (22.2%) pregnancies losses
      (ectopic pregnancies, miscarriages, terminations, and stillbirths). Of the
      completed pregnancies, 131670 (88.6%) were successfully linked with the
      offspring. The most commonly prescribed drugs were antibiotics, antimycotics,
      asthma/allergy medications, and analgesics. From 1996 to 2010, the proportion of 
      completed pregnancies with at least one prescription during the first trimester
      increased for antidepressants (1.8% to 4.2%), thyroid hormones (0.7% to 1.6%),
      and opiods (1.5% to 2.6%), among other drugs. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the
      prescription of several medications by primary care physicians during the first
      trimester of pregnancy has risen in the UK during the last decade. We discuss
      how, when important challenges are considered, THIN may be a promising resource
      to study specific therapies during pregnancy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We hypothesized that the higher mortality for hemodialysis patients
      who live farther from the closest attending nephrologist compared with patients
      living closer might be due to lower quality of care. STUDY DESIGN:
      Population-based longitudinal study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: All adult
      maintenance hemodialysis patients with measurements of quality-of-care indicators
      initiating hemodialysis therapy between January 2001 and June 2010 in Northern
      Alberta, Canada. PREDICTORS: Hemodialysis patients were classified into
      categories based on the distance by road from their residence to the closest
      nephrologist: </=50 (referent), 50.1-150, 150.1-300, and >300 km. OUTCOMES:
      Quality-of-care indicators were based on published guidelines. MEASUREMENTS:
      Quality-of-care indicators at 90 days following initiation of hemodialysis
      therapy and, in a secondary analysis, at 1 year. RESULTS: Measurements were
      available for 1,784 patients. At baseline, the proportions of patients residing
      in each category were 69% for </=50 km to closest nephrologist; 17%, 50.1-150 km;
      7%, 150.1-300 km; and 7%, >300 km. Those who lived farther away from the closest 
      nephrologist were less likely to have seen a nephrologist 90 days prior to the
      initiation of hemodialysis therapy (P for trend = 0.008) and were less likely to 
      receive Kt/V of 1.2 (adjusted OR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.30-0.84; P for trend = 0.01).
      Remote location also was associated with suboptimal levels of phosphate control
      (P for trend = 0.005). There were no differences in the prevalence of
      arteriovenous fistulas or grafts or hemoglobin levels across distance categories.
      LIMITATIONS: Registry data with limited data for non-guideline-based quality
      indicators. CONCLUSIONS: Although several quality-of-care indicators were less
      common in remote-dwelling hemodialysis patients, these differences do not appear 
      sufficient to explain the previously noted disparities in clinical outcomes by
      residence location.

TI  - Correlation of MRI grading of bone stress injuries with clinical risk factors and
      return to play: a 5-year prospective study in collegiate track and field
      athletes.
PG  - 1930-41
LID - 10.1177/0363546513490645 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bone stress injuries are common in track and field athletes.
      Knowledge of risk factors and correlation of these to magnetic resonance imaging 
      (MRI) grading could be helpful in determining recovery time. PURPOSE: To examine 
      the relationships between MRI grading of bone stress injuries with clinical risk 
      factors and time to return to sport in collegiate track and field athletes. STUDY
      DESIGN: Cohort study (prognosis); Level of evidence, 2. METHODS: A total of 211
      male and female collegiate track and field and cross-country athletes were
      followed prospectively through their competitive seasons. All athletes had
      preparticipation history, physical examination, and anthropometric measurements
      obtained annually. An additional questionnaire was completed regarding
      nutritional behaviors, menstrual patterns, and prior injuries, as well as a 3-day
      diet record. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry was performed at baseline and each 
      year of participation in the study. Athletes with clinical evidence of bone
      stress injuries had plain radiographs. If radiograph findings were negative, MRI 
      was performed. Bone stress injuries were evaluated by 2 independent radiologists 
      utilizing an MRI grading system. The MRI grading and risk factors were evaluated 
      to identify predictors of time to return to sport. RESULTS: Thirty-four of the
      athletes (12 men, 22 women) sustained 61 bone stress injuries during the 5-year
      study period. The mean prospective assessment for participants was 2.7 years. In 
      the multiple regression model, MRI grade and total-body bone mineral density
      (BMD) emerged as significant and independent predictors of time to return to
      sport. Specifically, the higher the MRI grade (P = .004) and lower the BMD (P =
      .030), the longer the recovery time. Location of the bone injury at predominantly
      trabecular sites of the femoral neck, pubic bone, and sacrum was also associated 
      with a prolonged time to return to sport. Female athletes with oligomenorrhea and
      amenorrhea had bone stress injuries of higher MRI grades compared with
      eumenorrheic athletes (P = .009). CONCLUSION: Higher MRI grade, lower BMD, and
      skeletal sites of predominant trabecular bone structures were associated with a
      delayed recovery of bone stress injuries in track and field athletes. Knowledge
      of these risk factors, as well as nutritional and menstrual factors, can be
      clinically useful in determining injury severity and time to return to sport.

TI  - Communication latencies of Apple push notification messages relevant for delivery
      of time-critical information to anesthesia providers.
PG  - 398-404
LID - 10.1213/ANE.0b013e318299a7f7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tablet computers and smart phones have gained popularity in
      anesthesia departments for educational and patient care purposes. VigiVU() is an 
      iOS application developed at Vanderbilt University for remote viewing of
      perioperative information, including text message notifications delivered via the
      Apple Push Notification (APN) service. In this study, we assessed the reliability
      of the APN service. METHODS: Custom software was written to send a message every 
      minute to iOS devices (iPad((R)), iPod Touch((R)), and iPhone((R))) via wireless 
      local area network (WLAN) and cellular pathways 24 hours a day over a 4-month
      period. Transmission and receipt times were recorded and batched by days, with
      latencies calculated as their differences. The mean, SEM, and the exact 95% upper
      confidence limits for the percent of days with >/=1 prolonged (>100 seconds)
      latency were calculated. Acceptable performance was defined as mean latency <30
      seconds and </=0.5% of latencies >100 seconds. Testing conditions included fixed 
      locations of devices in high signal strength locations. RESULTS: Mean latencies
      were <1 second for iPad and iPod devices (WLAN), and <4 seconds for iPhone
      (cellular). Among >173,000 iPad and iPod latencies, none were >100 seconds. For
      iPhone latencies, 0.03% +/- 0.01% were >100 seconds. The 95% upper confidence
      limits of days with >/=1 prolonged latency were 42% (iPhone) and 5% to 8% (iPad, 
      iPod). CONCLUSIONS: The APN service was reliable for all studied devices over
      WLAN and cellular pathways, and performance was better than third party paging
      systems using Internet connections previously investigated using the same
      criteria. However, since our study was a best-case assessment, testing is
      required at individual sites considering use of this technology for critical
      messaging. Furthermore, since the APN service may fail due to Internet or service
      provider disruptions, a backup paging system is recommended if the APN service
      were to be used for critical messaging.

TI  - The discriminatory cost of ICD-10-CM transition between clinical specialties:
      metrics, case study, and mitigating tools.
PG  - 708-17
LID - 10.1136/amiajnl-2012-001358 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Applying the science of networks to quantify the discriminatory impact
      of the ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM transition between clinical specialties. MATERIALS
      AND METHODS: Datasets were the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services ICD-9-CM
      to ICD-10-CM mapping files, general equivalence mappings, and statewide Medicaid 
      emergency department billing. Diagnoses were represented as nodes and their
      mappings as directional relationships. The complex network was synthesized as an 
      aggregate of simpler motifs and tabulation per clinical specialty. RESULTS: We
      identified five mapping motif categories: identity, class-to-subclass,
      subclass-to-class, convoluted, and no mapping. Convoluted mappings indicate that 
      multiple ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes share complex, entangled, and
      non-reciprocal mappings. The proportions of convoluted diagnoses mappings (36%
      overall) range from 5% (hematology) to 60% (obstetrics and injuries). In a case
      study of 24 008 patient visits in 217 emergency departments, 27% of the costs are
      associated with convoluted diagnoses, with 'abdominal pain' and 'gastroenteritis'
      accounting for approximately 3.5%. DISCUSSION: Previous qualitative studies
      report that administrators and clinicians are likely to be challenged in
      understanding and managing their practice because of the ICD-10-CM transition. We
      substantiate the complexity of this transition with a thorough quantitative
      summary per clinical specialty, a case study, and the tools to apply this
      methodology easily to any clinical practice in the form of a web portal and
      analytic tables. CONCLUSIONS: Post-transition, successful management of frequent 
      diseases with convoluted mapping network patterns is critical. The
      http://lussierlab.org/transition-to-ICD10CM web portal provides insight in
      linking onerous diseases to the ICD-10 transition.

TI  - Optimized quantitative magnetic resonance spectroscopy for clinical routine.
PG  - 25-32
LID - 10.1002/mrm.24455 [doi]
AB  - Several practical obstacles in data handling and evaluation complicate the use of
      quantitative localized magnetic resonance spectroscopy (qMRS) in clinical routine
      MR examinations. To overcome these obstacles, a clinically feasible MR pulse
      sequence protocol based on standard available MR pulse sequences for qMRS has
      been implemented along with newly added functionalities to the free software
      package jMRUI-v5.0 to make qMRS attractive for clinical routine. This enables (a)
      easy and fast DICOM data transfer from the MR console and the qMRS-computer, (b) 
      visualization of combined MR spectroscopy and imaging, (c) creation and network
      transfer of spectroscopy reports in DICOM format, (d) integration of advanced
      water reference models for absolute quantification, and (e) setup of databases
      containing normal metabolite concentrations of healthy subjects. To demonstrate
      the work-flow of qMRS using these implementations, databases for normal
      metabolite concentration in different regions of brain tissue were created using 
      spectroscopic data acquired in 55 normal subjects (age range 6-61 years) using
      1.5T and 3T MR systems, and illustrated in one clinical case of typical brain
      tumor (primitive neuroectodermal tumor). The MR pulse sequence protocol and newly
      implemented software functionalities facilitate the incorporation of qMRS and
      reference to normal value metabolite concentration data in daily clinical
      routine.

TI  - Effect of an outpatient antimicrobial stewardship intervention on broad-spectrum 
      antibiotic prescribing by primary care pediatricians: a randomized trial.
PG  - 2345-52
LID - 10.1001/jama.2013.6287 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Antimicrobial stewardship programs have been effective for
      inpatients, often through prescribing audit and feedback. However, most
      antimicrobial use occurs in outpatients with acute respiratory tract infections
      (ARTIs). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of an antimicrobial stewardship
      intervention on antibiotic prescribing for pediatric outpatients. DESIGN: Cluster
      randomized trial of outpatient antimicrobial stewardship comparing prescribing
      between intervention and control practices using a common electronic health
      record. After excluding children with chronic medical conditions, antibiotic
      allergies, and prior antibiotic use, we estimated prescribing rates for targeted 
      ARTIs standardized for age, sex, race, and insurance from 20 months before the
      intervention to 12 months afterward (October 2008-June 2011). SETTING AND
      PARTICIPANTS: A network of 25 pediatric primary care practices in Pennsylvania
      and New Jersey; 18 practices (162 clinicians) participated. INTERVENTIONS: One
      1-hour on-site clinician education session (June 2010) followed by 1 year of
      personalized, quarterly audit and feedback of prescribing for bacterial and viral
      ARTIs or usual practice. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Rates of broad-spectrum
      (off-guideline) antibiotic prescribing for bacterial ARTIs and antibiotics for
      viral ARTIs for 1 year after the intervention. RESULTS: Broad-spectrum antibiotic
      prescribing decreased from 26.8% to 14.3% (absolute difference, 12.5%) among
      intervention practices vs from 28.4% to 22.6% (absolute difference, 5.8%) in
      controls (difference of differences [DOD], 6.7%; P = .01 for differences in
      trajectories). Off-guideline prescribing for children with pneumonia decreased
      from 15.7% to 4.2% among intervention practices compared with 17.1% to 16.3% in
      controls (DOD, 10.7%; P < .001) and for acute sinusitis from 38.9% to 18.8% in
      intervention practices and from 40.0% to 33.9% in controls (DOD, 14.0%; P = .12).
      Off-guideline prescribing was uncommon at baseline and changed little for
      streptococcal pharyngitis (intervention, from 4.4% to 3.4%; control, from 5.6% to
      3.5%; DOD, -1.1%; P = .82) and for viral infections (intervention, from 7.9% to
      7.7%; control, from 6.4% to 4.5%; DOD, -1.7%; P = .93). CONCLUSIONS AND
      RELEVANCE: In this large pediatric primary care network, clinician education
      coupled with audit and feedback, compared with usual practice, improved adherence
      to prescribing guidelines for common bacterial ARTIs, and the intervention did
      not affect antibiotic prescribing for viral infections. Future studies should
      examine the drivers of these effects, as well as the generalizability,
      sustainability, and clinical outcomes of outpatient antimicrobial stewardship.

AB  - The feasibility of using imperfectly phenotyped "silver standard" samples
      identified from electronic medical record diagnoses is considered in genetic
      association studies when these samples might be combined with an existing set of 
      samples phenotyped with a gold standard technique. An analytic expression is
      derived for the power of a chi-square test of independence using either
      research-quality case/control samples alone, or augmented with silver standard
      data. The subset of the parameter space where inclusion of silver standard
      samples increases statistical power is identified. A case study of dementia
      subjects identified from electronic medical records from the Electronic Medical
      Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network, combined with subjects from two studies
      specifically targeting dementia, verifies these results.

TI  - Outcome and frequency of sodium disturbances in neurocritically ill patients.
PG  - 139-45
LID - 10.1007/s13760-012-0137-7 [doi]
AB  - Sodium disturbances are frequent and serious complications in neurocritically ill
      patients. Hyponatremia is more common than hypernatremia, which is, however,
      prognostically worse. The aim of this study was to analyse outcome and frequency 
      of sodium disturbances in relation to measured serum osmolality in
      neurologic-neurosurgical critically ill patients. A 5-year retrospective
      collection of patients (pts) and laboratory data were made from the Laboratory
      Information System database in the Clinical Biochemistry Department. The criteria
      for patients' inclusion was acute brain disease and serum sodium (SNa(+)) <135
      mmol/l (hyponatremia) or SNa(+) >150 mmol/l (hypernatremia). Hypoosmolality was
      defined as measured serum osmolality (SOsm) <275 mmol/kg, hyperosmolality as SOsm
      >295 mmol/kg. We performed analysis of differences between hyponatremia and
      hypernatremia and subanalysis of differences between hypoosmolal hyponatremia and
      hypernatremia. From 1,440 pts with acute brain diseases there were 251 (17 %) pts
      with hyponatremia (mean SNa(+) 131.78 +/- 2.89 mmol/l, SOsm 279.46 +/- 11.84
      mmol/kg) and 75 (5 %) pts with hypernatremia (mean SNa(+) 154.38 +/- 3.76 mmol/l,
      SOsm 326.07 +/- 15.93 mmol/kg). Hypoosmolal hyponatremia occurred in 50 (20 % of 
      hyponatremic patients) pts (mean SNa(+) 129.62 +/- 4.15 mmol/l; mean SOsm 267.35 
      +/- 6.28 mmol/kg). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that
      hypernatremia is a significant predictor of mortality during
      neurologic-neurosurgical intensive care unit (NNICU) stay (OR 5.3, p = 0.002) but
      not a predictor of bad outcome upon discharge from NNICU, defined as Glasgow Coma
      Scale 1-3. These results showed that hypernatremia occurred less frequently than 
      all hyponatremias, but more often than hypoosmolal hyponatremia. Hypernatremia
      was shown to be a significant predictor of NNICU mortality compared to
      hyponatremia.

TI  - Primary-care observational database study of the efficacy of GLP-1 receptor
      agonists and insulin in the UK.
PG  - 681-6
LID - 10.1111/dme.12137 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: We investigated use and efficacy of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)
      receptor agonists in UK practice. METHODS: People starting a GLP-1 receptor
      agonist (exenatide, liraglutide) or insulin (glargine, detemir, NPH) after a
      regimen of two or three oral glucose-lowering agents were identified from The
      Health Information Network observational primary care database (2007-2011). Mean 
      change in HbA1c and body weight were compared at 1 year between cohorts,
      adjusting for baseline characteristics. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics of
      GLP-1 receptor agonist (n = 1123) vs. insulin (n = 1842) users were HbA1c 78 vs. 
      84 mmol/mol (9.3 vs. 9.8%) and BMI 38.2 vs. 30.9 kg/m(2). The GLP-1 receptor
      agonist cohort was younger, had shorter diabetes duration and follow-up, less
      microvascular disease and heart failure, higher estimated glomerular filtration
      rate and more use of oral glucose-lowering agents. Lower HbA1c reduction on GLP-1
      receptor agonist [7 vs. 13 mmol/mol (0.6 vs. 1.2%) (n = 366 vs. 892)] was not
      statistically significant [adjusted mean difference -1.4 (95% CI -4.1, 1.2)
      mmol/mol], except in the highest HbA1c quintile [>96 mmol/mol (>10.9%); adjusted 
      mean difference -17.8 (-28.6, -7.0) mmol/mol]. GLP-1 receptor agonist users lost 
      weight [-4.5 vs. +1.5 kg; adjusted mean difference 4.7 (3.7, 5.8) kg; n = 335 vs.
      634]. A UK 6-month target reduction for GLP-1 receptor agonists of 11 mmol/mol
      (1.0%) HbA1c and 3% weight was reached by 24.9% of those continuing treatment.
      CONCLUSIONS: Those starting GLP-1 receptor agonists are heavier with better
      glycaemic control than those starting basal insulin. Subsequently, they have
      improved weight change, with similar HbA1c reduction unless baseline HbA1c is
      very high. The UK 6-month GLP-1 receptor agonist target is usually not reached.

TI  - Use of an electronic health record clinical decision support tool to improve
      antibiotic prescribing for acute respiratory infections: the ABX-TRIP study.
PG  - 810-6
LID - 10.1007/s11606-012-2267-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antibiotics are often inappropriately prescribed for acute
      respiratory infections (ARIs). OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of a clinical
      decision support system (CDSS) on antibiotic prescribing for ARIs. DESIGN: A
      two-phase, 27-month demonstration project. SETTING: Nine primary care practices
      in PPRNet, a practice-based research network whose members use a common
      electronic health record (EHR). PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-nine providers were included
      in the project. INTERVENTION: A CDSS was designed as an EHR progress note
      template. To facilitate CDSS implementation, each practice participated in two to
      three site visits, sent representatives to two project meetings, and received
      quarterly performance reports on antibiotic prescribing for ARIs. MAIN OUTCOME
      MEASURES: 1) Use of antibiotics for inappropriate indications. 2) Use of broad
      spectrum antibiotics when inappropriate. 3) Use of antibiotics for sinusitis and 
      bronchitis. KEY RESULTS: The CDSS was used 38,592 times during the 27-month
      intervention; its use was sustained for the study duration. Use of antibiotics
      for encounters at which diagnoses for which antibiotics are rarely appropriate
      did not significantly change through the course of the study (estimated 27-month 
      change, 1.57% [95% CI, -5.35%, 8.49%] in adults and -1.89% [95% CI, -9.03%,
      5.26%] in children). However, use of broad spectrum antibiotics for ARI
      encounters improved significantly (estimated 27 month change, -16.30%, [95% CI,
      -24.81%, -7.79%] in adults and -16.30 [95%CI, -23.29%, -9.31%] in children).
      Prescribing for bronchitis did not change significantly, but use of broad
      spectrum antibiotics for sinusitis declined. CONCLUSIONS: This multi-method
      intervention appears to have had a sustained impact on reducing the use of broad 
      spectrum antibiotics for ARIs. This intervention shows promise for promoting
      judicious antibiotic use in primary care.

TI  - A social network of hospital acquired infection built from electronic medical
      record data.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Social networks have been used in the study of outbreaks of infectious
      diseases, including in small group settings such as individual hospitals.
      Collecting the data needed to create such networks, however, can be time
      consuming, costly, and error prone. We sought to create a social network of
      hospital inpatients using electronic medical record (EMR) data already collected 
      for other purposes, for use in simulating outbreaks of nosocomial infections.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used the EMR data warehouse of a tertiary academic
      hospital to model contact among inpatients. Patient-to-patient contact due to
      shared rooms was inferred from admission-discharge-transfer data, and contact
      with healthcare workers was inferred from clinical documents. Contacts were used 
      to generate a social network, which was then used to conduct probabilistic
      simulations of nosocomial outbreaks of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
      aureus and influenza. RESULTS: Simulations of infection transmission across the
      network reflected the staffing and patient flow practices of the hospital.
      Simulations modeling patient isolation, increased hand hygiene, and staff
      vaccination showed a decrease in the spread of infection. DISCUSSION: We
      developed a method of generating a social network of hospital inpatients from EMR
      data. This method allows the derivation of networks that reflect the local
      hospital environment, obviate the need for simulated or manually collected data, 
      and can be updated in near real time. CONCLUSIONS: Inpatient social networks
      represent a novel secondary use of EMR data, and can be used to simulate
      nosocomial infections. Future work should focus on prospective validation of the 
      simulations, and adapting such networks to other tasks.

TI  - Assessing the impact of mobile technology on order verification during pharmacist
      participation in patient rounds.
PG  - 633-6
LID - 10.2146/ajhp120219 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Pharmacists' use of mobile technology (MT) to verify medication orders
      placed during their participation in medical rounds is investigated. METHODS: A
      retrospective observational study was conducted at a large academic medical
      center to assess the impact of MT on the average time to pharmacist verification 
      of medication orders written by general medicine staff during pharmacist
      participation in patient rounds. A total of 260 medication orders for 129
      patients were evaluated: 146 orders processed over a one-month period during
      which rounding pharmacists verified orders using stationary computer terminals on
      patient care units and 114 orders processed using an MT device. The primary
      endpoint was the average time to pharmacist verification for all medication
      orders; average verification times for orders for specific medication classes
      (analgesics, antibiotics, antidiabetes drugs, and antihypertensives) were also
      evaluated. RESULTS: Overall, the average time to order verification was
      significantly lower with the use of the MT device compared with non-MT-assisted
      order verification (7.5 minutes versus 38.9 minutes, p < 0.001), with significant
      (p < 0.001) time benefits favoring MT-assisted verification for all order subsets
      within the evaluated medication classes. Challenges posed by the use of
      MT-assisted order verification included the selected device's relatively small
      keyboard and the frequent loss of network connections as the pharmacist moved
      from floor to floor within the hospital. CONCLUSION: Clinical pharmacists' use of
      an MT device to verify medication orders written during patient care rounds can
      significantly decrease the average time required for order verification relative 
      to the use of stationary computer terminals.

AB  - In the coming decades, cancer will be a major clinical and public health issue in
      sub-Saharan Africa. However, clinical and public health infrastructure and
      services in many countries are not positioned to deal with the growing cancer
      burden. Pathology is a core service required to serve many needs related to
      cancer in sub-Saharan Africa. Cancer diagnosis, treatment, and research all
      depend on adequate pathology. Pathology is also necessary for cancer
      registration, which is needed to accurately estimate cancer incidence and
      mortality. Cancer registry data directly guide policy-makers' decisions for
      cancer control and the allocation of clinical and public health services. Despite
      the centrality of pathology in many components of cancer care and control,
      countries in sub-Saharan Africa have at best a tenth of the pathology coverage of
      that in high-income countries. Equipment, processes, and services are lacking,
      and there is a need for quality assurance for the definition and implementation
      of high-quality, accurate diagnosis. Training and advocacy for pathology are also
      needed. We propose approaches to improve the status of pathology in sub-Saharan
      Africa to address the needs of patients with cancer and other diseases.

TI  - Implementation and first results of a German chronic kidney disease registry.
PG  - 184-91
LID - 10.5414/CN107749 [doi]
AB  - Advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) is gaining increasing medical and
      economical importance, but little information exists about treatment variation
      and the impact of routine clinical treatments on survival, quality of life, and
      cost. We demonstrate the first results of a national electronic registry of
      nephrology clinic data that will serve as a resource for the prospective
      observation of CKD patients in Germany. A large network of German nephrologist
      practices is currently joining the project. Routinely obtained clinical data for 
      non-dialysis dependent CKD patients are documented in health records
      electronically, and elements from these data are extracted using QuaNT
      (Qualitatssicherung Nephrologie und Transplantation) to create a centralized
      database. Here, we report cross-sectional data from 59 participating nephrology
      clinics and 6,187 patients with CKD Stage 3 - 5 in 2011. Mean age +/- standard
      deviation (SD) was 72 +/- 12 years. The distribution of CKD 3, 4, and 5
      (non-dialysis) was 60%, 33%, and 8%, respectively. The major renal diseases were 
      hypertension/vascular nephropathy (47%) and diabetic nephropathy (26%).
      Reninangiotensin-system inhibitor prescription was 78%. Vitamin D prescription
      was 50%, phosphate binders 6%, iron (oral or i.v.) 19%, and
      erythropoietin-stimulating agents 14%. This electronic registry follows clinical 
      nephrology care and outcomes for CKD patients in Germany, and increased
      participation is anticipated. As a component of the initiative, variation in
      patient care will be studied to identify best treatment practices in analyses
      integrated into the international CKD Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study
      (CKDopps).

PG  - 305-11
LID - 10.1109/TITB.2012.2227272 [doi]
AB  - Large collections of electronic patient records provide abundant but
      under-explored information on the real-world use of medicines. Although they are 
      maintained for patient administration, they provide a broad range of clinical
      information for data analysis. One growing interest is drug safety signal
      detection from these longitudinal observational data. In this paper, we proposed 
      two novel algorithms-a likelihood ratio model and a Bayesian network model-for
      adverse drug effect discovery. Although the performance of these two algorithms
      is comparable to the state-of-the-art algorithm, Bayesian confidence propagation 
      neural network, the combination of three works better due to their diversity in
      solutions. Since the actual adverse drug effects on a given dataset cannot be
      absolutely determined, we make use of the simulated observational medical
      outcomes partnership (OMOP) dataset constructed with the predefined adverse drug 
      effects to evaluate our methods. Experimental results show the usefulness of the 
      proposed pattern discovery method on the simulated OMOP dataset by improving the 
      standard baseline algorithm-chi-square-by 23.83%.

TI  - Modeling temporal relationships in large scale clinical associations.
PG  - 332-41
LID - 10.1136/amiajnl-2012-001117 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We describe an approach for modeling temporal relationships in a large
      scale association analysis of electronic health record data. The addition of
      temporal information can inform hypothesis generation and help to explain the
      relationships. We applied this approach on a dataset containing 41.2 million
      time-stamped International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9)
      codes from 1.6 million patients. METHODS: We performed two independent analyses
      including a pairwise association analysis using a chi(2) test and a temporal
      analysis using a binomial test. Data were visualized using network diagrams and
      reviewed for clinical significance. RESULTS: We found nearly 400 000 highly
      associated pairs of ICD-9 codes with varying numbers of strong temporal
      associations ranging from >/=1 day to >/=10 years apart. Most of the findings
      were not considered clinically novel, although some, such as an association
      between Helicobacter pylori infection and diabetes, have recently been reported
      in the literature. The temporal analysis in our large cohort, however, revealed
      that diabetes usually preceded the diagnoses of H pylori, raising questions about
      possible cause and effect. DISCUSSION: Such analyses have significant
      limitations, some of which are due to known problems with ICD-9 codes and others 
      to potentially incomplete data even at a health system level. Nevertheless, large
      scale association analyses with temporal modeling can help provide a mechanism
      for novel discovery in support of hypothesis generation. CONCLUSIONS: Temporal
      relationships can provide an additional layer of meaning in identifying and
      interpreting clinical associations.

TI  - Impact of a clinical decision support system on antibiotic prescribing for acute 
      respiratory infections in primary care: quasi-experimental trial.
PG  - 317-24
LID - 10.1136/amiajnl-2011-000701 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of a clinical decision support system (CDSS)
      integrated into an electronic health record (EHR) on antibiotic prescribing for
      acute respiratory infections (ARIs) in primary care. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
      Quasi-experimental design with nine intervention practices and 61 control
      practices in the Practice Partner Research Network, a network of practices which 
      all use the same EHR (Practice Partner). The nine intervention practices were
      located in nine US states. The design included a 3-month baseline data collection
      period (October through December 2009) before the introduction of the
      intervention and 15 months of follow-up (January 2010 through March 2011). The
      main outcome measures were the prescribing of antibiotics in ARI episodes for
      which antibiotics are inappropriate and prescribing of broad-spectrum antibiotics
      in all ARI episodes. RESULTS: In adult patients, prescribing of antibiotics in
      ARI episodes where antibiotics are inappropriate declined more (-0.6%) among
      intervention practices than in control practices (+4.2%) (p=0.03). However, among
      adults, the CDSS intervention improved prescribing of broad-spectrum antibiotics,
      with a decline of 16.6% among intervention practices versus an increase of 1.1%
      in control practices (p<0.0001). A similar effect on broad-spectrum antibiotic
      prescribing was found in pediatric patients with a decline of 19.7% among
      intervention practices versus an increase of 0.9% in control practices
      (p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: A CDSS embedded in an EHR had a modest effect in
      changing prescribing for adults where antibiotics were inappropriate but had a
      substantial impact on changing the overall prescribing of broad-spectrum
      antibiotics among pediatric and adult patients.

TI  - Prevalence and treatment patterns of psoriatic arthritis in the UK.
PG  - 568-75
LID - 10.1093/rheumatology/kes324 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to determine the prevalence of PsA 
      in The Health Improvement Network (THIN), a large population-based medical
      records database in the UK, to examine factors associated with prevalent PsA
      among patients with psoriasis and to describe the use of DMARDs in patients with 
      PsA. METHODS: Two cohorts were derived from THIN to examine the prevalence of PsA
      in a cross-sectional study among all patients aged 18-90 years and among a
      subcohort of 4900 psoriasis patients aged 45-65 years. Prescription codes were
      used to describe therapies after the diagnosis of PsA. Associations for prevalent
      PsA among psoriasis patients were assessed using logistic regression analysis.
      RESULTS: Among 4.8 million patients in THIN between the ages of 18 and 90 years, 
      9045 patients had at least one medical code for PsA, giving an overall prevalence
      of 0.19% (95% CI 0.19%, 0.19%). Of those patients, 45.9% with PsA have been
      prescribed DMARDs. Among the 4064 confirmed psoriasis patients, the prevalence of
      PsA was 8.6% (95% CI 7.7%, 9.5%). PsA was more prevalent among patients with
      severe psoriasis [odds ratio (OR) 3.34; 95% CI 2.40, 4.65], obesity (OR 1.77; 95%
      CI 1.30, 2.41) and duration of psoriasis for >/=10 years (OR 7.42; 95% CI 3.86,
      14.25) in the fully adjusted model. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of PsA in THIN is 
      consistent with previous population-based estimates. Limitations include a
      definition of PsA based on a diagnostic code rather than Classification Criteria 
      for Psoriatic Arthritis (CASPAR) criteria. Given the large population of PsA
      patients, THIN is an important resource for the study of PsA.

TI  - An evaluation of the THIN database in the OMOP Common Data Model for active drug 
      safety surveillance.
PG  - 119-34
LID - 10.1007/s40264-012-0009-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There has been increased interest in using multiple observational
      databases to understand the safety profile of medical products during the
      postmarketing period. However, it is challenging to perform analyses across these
      heterogeneous data sources. The Observational Medical Outcome Partnership (OMOP) 
      provides a Common Data Model (CDM) for organizing and standardizing databases.
      OMOP's work with the CDM has primarily focused on US databases. As a participant 
      in the OMOP Extended Consortium, we implemented the OMOP CDM on the UK Electronic
      Healthcare Record database-The Health Improvement Network (THIN). OBJECTIVE: The 
      aim of the study was to evaluate the implementation of the THIN database in the
      OMOP CDM and explore its use for active drug safety surveillance. METHODS:
      Following the OMOP CDM specification, the raw THIN database was mapped into a CDM
      THIN database. Ten Drugs of Interest (DOI) and nine Health Outcomes of Interest
      (HOI), defined and focused by the OMOP, were created using the CDM THIN database.
      Quantitative comparison of raw THIN to CDM THIN was performed by execution and
      analysis of OMOP standardized reports and additional analyses. The practical
      value of CDM THIN for drug safety and pharmacoepidemiological research was
      assessed by implementing three analysis methods: Proportional Reporting Ratio
      (PRR), Univariate Self-Case Control Series (USCCS) and High-Dimensional
      Propensity Score (HDPS). A published study using raw THIN data was selected to
      examine the external validity of CDM THIN. RESULTS: Overall demographic
      characteristics were the same in both databases. Mapping medical and drug codes
      into the OMOP terminology dictionary was incomplete: 25 % medical codes and 55 % 
      drug codes in raw THIN were not listed in the OMOP terminology dictionary,
      representing 6 % condition occurrence counts, 4 % procedure occurrence counts and
      7 % drug exposure counts in raw THIN. Seven DOIs had <0.3 % and three DOIs had 1 
      % of unmapped drug exposure counts; each HOI had at least one definition with no 
      or minimal (</=0.2 %) issues with unmapped condition occurrence counts, except
      for the upper gastrointestinal (UGI) ulcer hospitalization cohort. The
      application of PRR, USCCS and HDPS found, respectively, a sensitivity of 67, 78
      and 50 %, and a specificity of 68, 59 and 76 %, suggesting that safety issues
      defined as known by the OMOP could be identified in CDM THIN, with imperfect
      performance. Similar PRR scores were produced using both CDM THIN and raw THIN,
      while the execution time was twice as fast on CDM THIN. There was close
      replication of demographic distribution, death rate and prescription pattern and 
      trend in the published study population and the cohort of CDM THIN. CONCLUSIONS: 
      This research demonstrated that information loss due to incomplete mapping of
      medical and drug codes as well as data structure in the current CDM THIN limits
      its use for all possible epidemiological evaluation studies. Current HOIs and
      DOIs predefined by the OMOP were constructed with minimal loss of information and
      can be used for active surveillance methodological research. The OMOP CDM THIN
      can be a valuable tool for multiple aspects of pharmacoepidemiological research
      when the unique features of UK Electronic Health Records are incorporated in the 
      OMOP library.

TI  - 16(th) IHIW: analysis of HLA population data, with updated results for 1996 to
      2012 workshop data (AHPD project report).
PG  - 21-30
LID - 10.1111/iji.12033 [doi]
AB  - We present here the results of the Analysis of HLA Population Data (AHPD) project
      of the 16th International HLA and Immunogenetics Workshop (16IHIW) held in
      Liverpool in May-June 2012. Thanks to the collaboration of 25 laboratories from
      18 different countries, HLA genotypic data for 59 new population samples (either 
      well-defined populations or donor registry samples) were gathered and 55 were
      analysed statistically following HLA-NET recommendations. The new data included, 
      among others, large sets of well-defined populations from north-east Europe and
      West Asia, as well as many donor registry data from European countries. The
      Gene[rate] computer tools were combined to create a Gene[rate] computer pipeline 
      to automatically (i) estimate allele frequencies by an expectation-maximization
      algorithm accommodating ambiguities, (ii) estimate heterozygosity, (iii) test for
      Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), (iv) test for selective neutrality, (v)
      generate frequency graphs and summary statistics for each sample at each locus
      and (vi) plot multidimensional scaling (MDS) analyses comparing the new samples
      with previous IHIW data. Intrapopulation analyses show that HWE is rarely
      rejected, while neutrality tests often indicate a significant excess of
      heterozygotes compared with neutral expectations. The comparison of the 16IHIW
      AHPD data with data collected during previous workshops (12th-15th) shows that
      geography is an excellent predictor of HLA genetic differentiations for HLA-A, -B
      and -DRB1 loci but not for HLA-DQ, whose patterns are probably more influenced by
      natural selection. In Europe, HLA genetic variation clearly follows a north to
      south-east axis despite a low level of differentiation between European, North
      African and West Asian populations. Pacific populations are genetically close to 
      Austronesian-speaking South-East Asian and Taiwanese populations, in agreement
      with current theories on the peopling of Oceania. Thanks to this project, HLA
      genetic variation is more clearly defined worldwide and better interpreted in
      relation to human peopling history and HLA molecular evolution.

TI  - Using a health information exchange system for imaging information: patterns and 
      predictors.
PG  - 1402-11
AB  - Health information exchange (HIE) systems may address the challenges that prevent
      easy access to patients' existing radiological information at the point of care. 
      However, little is known about the factors associated with usage of HIE for
      radiology reports, nor about how reports are shared with an exchange network. We 
      analyzed the system log files from a regional health information organization in 
      upstate New York matched with insurance claims files using network analysis and
      regression modeling. The exchange network was dominated by a few key information 
      sources. Outpatient users overall accessed 17 times more radiology reports than
      inpatient and ED users combined. Additionally, as the number of exchange partners
      increased per organization, the average number of reports exchanged by that
      organization also increased. Radiology reports were most likely to be accessed by
      physicians and other clinical users. These findings have implications for those
      operating and fostering exchange activity.

TI  - An early illness recognition framework using a temporal Smith Waterman algorithm 
      and NLP.
PG  - 548-57
AB  - In this paper we propose a framework for detecting health patterns based on
      non-wearable sensor sequence similarity and natural language processing (NLP). In
      TigerPlace, an aging in place facility from Columbia, MO, we deployed 47 sensor
      networks together with a nursing electronic health record (EHR) system to provide
      early illness recognition. The proposed framework utilizes sensor sequence
      similarity and NLP on EHR nursing comments to automatically notify the physician 
      when health problems are detected. The reported methodology is inspired by
      genomic sequence annotation using similarity algorithms such as Smith Waterman
      (SW). Similarly, for each sensor sequence, we associate health concepts extracted
      from the nursing notes using Metamap, a NLP tool provided by Unified Medical
      Language System (UMLS). Since sensor sequences, unlike genomics ones, have an
      associated time dimension we propose a temporal variant of SW (TSW) to account
      for time. The main challenges presented by our framework are finding the most
      suitable time sequence similarity and aggregation of the retrieved UMLS concepts.
      On a pilot dataset from three Tiger Place residents, with a total of 1685 sensor 
      days and 626 nursing records, we obtained an average precision of 0.64 and a
      recall of 0.37.

TI  - Potential value of health information exchange for people with epilepsy:
      crossover patterns and missing clinical data.
PG  - 527-36
AB  - CONTEXT: For people with epilepsy, the potential value of health information
      exchange (HIE) is unknown. METHODS: We reviewed two years of clinical encounters 
      for 8055 people with epilepsy from seven Manhattan hospitals. We created network 
      graphs illustrating crossover among these hospitals for multiple encounter types,
      and calculated a novel metric of care fragmentation: "encounters at risk for
      missing clinical data." RESULTS: Given two hospitals, a median of 109 [range 46 -
      588] patients with epilepsy had visited both. Due to this crossover, recent,
      relevant clinical data may be missing at the time of care frequently (44.8% of ED
      encounters, 34.5% inpatient, 24.9% outpatient, and 23.2% radiology). Though a
      smaller percentage of outpatient encounters were at risk for missing data than ED
      encounters, the absolute number of outpatient encounters at risk was three times 
      higher (14,579 vs. 5041). CONCLUSION: People with epilepsy may benefit from HIE. 
      Future HIE initiatives should prioritize outpatient access.

AB  - Electronic Health Record (EHR) is a distributed system that results from the
      cooperation of several heterogeneous and autonomous subsystems. It improves
      health care by enabling access to prior diagnostic information to assist in
      health decisions. We focus on the image and imaging report visualization
      component that needs to interoperate with several other systems to enable
      healthcare professionals visualize a patient's imaging record. We propose and
      describe an environment that has been built and used to facilitate the
      development of the viewer component. This environment has also been used to test 
      and verify the interoperability of the viewer component with other EHR components
      in accordance with the Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE) technical
      framework. It has also been used to demonstrate functionalities, to educate end
      users, and to train maintenance and test engineers. Moreover, it has been used
      for acceptance testing as part of an EHR deployment project. We also discuss the 
      challenges we faced in constructing the testing data and describe the software
      developed to automatically populate the test environment with valid data.

PG  - 37-53
LID - 10.3109/17538157.2012.674586 [doi]
AB  - The objective of this work was the proposal, design, construction and validation 
      of a mobile health system for dietetic monitoring and assessment, called SapoFit.
      This application may be personalized to keep a daily personal health record of an
      individual's food intake and daily exercise and to share this with a social
      network. The initiative is a partnership with SAPO - Portugal Telecom. SapoFit
      uses Web services architecture, a relatively new model for distributed computing 
      and application integration. SapoFit runs on a range of mobile platforms, and it 
      has been implemented successfully in a range of mobile devices and has been
      evaluated by over 100 users. Most users strongly agree that SapoFit has an
      attractive design, the environment is user-friendly and intuitive, and the
      navigation options are clear.

TI  - Electronic dental record use and clinical information management patterns among
      practitioner-investigators in The Dental Practice-Based Research Network.
PG  - 49-58
AB  - BACKGROUND: The growing availability of electronic data offers practitioners
      increased opportunities for reusing clinical data for research and quality
      improvement. However, relatively little is known about what clinical data
      practitioners keep on their computers regarding patients. METHODS: The authors
      conducted a web-based survey of 991 U.S. and Scandinavian
      practitioner-investigators (P-Is) in The Dental Practice-Based Research Network
      to determine the extent of their use of computers to manage clinical information;
      the type of patient information they kept on paper, a computer or both; and their
      willingness to reuse electronic dental record (EDR) data for research. RESULTS: A
      total of 729 (73.6 percent) of 991 P-Is responded.A total of 73.8 percent of U.S.
      solo practitioners and 78.7 percent of group practitioners used a computer to
      manage some patient information, and 14.3 percent and 15.9 percent, respectively,
      managed all patient information on a computer. U.S. practitioners stored
      appointments, treatment plans, completed treatment and images electronically most
      frequently, and the periodontal charting, diagnosis, medical history, progress
      notes and the chief complaint least frequently.More than 90 percent of
      Scandinavian practitioners stored all information electronically.A total of 50.8 
      percent of all P-Is were willing to reuse EDR data for research, and 63.1 percent
      preferred electronic forms for data collection. CONCLUSION: The results of this
      study show that the trend toward increased adoption of EDRs in the United States 
      is continuing, potentially making more data in electronic form available for
      research. Participants appear to be willing to reuse EDR data for research and to
      collect data electronically. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The rising rates of EDR
      adoption may offer increased opportunities for reusing electronic data for
      quality improvement and research.

TI  - Multispecialty physician networks in Ontario.
PG  - e40-55
AB  - BACKGROUND: Large multispecialty physician group practices, with a central role
      for primary care practitioners, have been shown to achieve high-quality, low-cost
      care for patients with chronic disease. We assessed the extent to which informal 
      multispecialty physician networks in Ontario could be identified by using health 
      administrative data to exploit natural linkages among patients, physicians, and
      hospitals based on existing patient flow. METHODS: We linked each Ontario
      resident to his or her usual provider of primary care over the period from fiscal
      year 2008/2009 to fiscal year 2010/2011. We linked each specialist to the
      hospital where he or she performed the most inpatient services. We linked each
      primary care physician to the hospital where most of his or her ambulatory
      patients were admitted for non-maternal medical care. Each resident was then
      linked to the same hospital as his or her usual provider of primary care. We
      computed "loyalty" as the proportion of care to network residents provided by
      physicians and hospitals within their network. Smaller clusters were aggregated
      to create networks based on a minimum population size, distance, and loyalty.
      Networks were not constrained geographically. RESULTS: We identified 78
      multispecialty physician networks, comprising 12,410 primary care physicians,
      14,687 specialists, and 175 acute care hospitals serving a total of 12,917,178
      people. Median network size was 134,723 residents, 125 primary care physicians,
      and 143 specialists. Virtually all eligible residents were linked to a usual
      provider of primary care and to a network. Most specialists (93.5%) and primary
      care physicians (98.2%) were linked to a hospital. Median network physician
      loyalty was 68.4% for all physician visits and 81.1% for primary care visits.
      Median non-maternal admission loyalty was 67.4%. Urban networks had lower
      loyalties and were less self-contained but had more health care resources.
      INTERPRETATION: We demonstrated the feasibility of identifying informal
      multispecialty physician networks in Ontario on the basis of patterns of health
      care-seeking behaviour. Networks were reasonably self-contained, in that
      individual residents received most of their care from providers within their
      respective networks. Formal constitution of networks could foster accountability 
      for efficient, integrated care through care management tools and quality
      improvement, the ideas behind "accountable care organizations."

TI  - Identifying periods of acceptable computer usage in primary care research
      databases.
PG  - 64-9
LID - 10.1002/pds.3368 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To examine the effect of applying different data quality filters on the 
      incidence of disease and prescribing trends over time in a primary care research 
      database and validate a new method for defining periods of adequate computer
      usage. METHODS: Acceptable computer usage (ACU) was defined as the year in which 
      a general practice was continuously entering on average at least two therapy
      records, one medical record and one additional health data record per patient per
      year. The effect of using this date on the incidence of a range of outcomes
      (antibiotic prescriptions, myocardial infarction, colon cancer, lung cancer) over
      time was compared with other methods for defining the start of patient follow-up 
      in The Health Improvement Network (THIN) primary care database containing UK
      patient records. Various combinations of the follow-up start dates were applied
      to the data to calculate incidence rates: (i) registration date, (ii) practice
      computerization date, (iii) acceptable mortality recording (AMR) (iv) ACU.
      RESULTS: On average, the ACU date was 3.3 years after the AMR date. Applying the 
      AMR or ACU dates separately or in combination produced trends in incidence rates 
      more comparable with external data sources than using the year of practice
      registration or computerization. The estimated incidence rates were highly
      sensitive to different methods of defining start date in early time periods.
      CONCLUSIONS: Using the latest of AMR and ACU dates is useful for improving the
      integrity of THIN data.

TI  - Healthcare worker contact networks and the prevention of hospital-acquired
      infections.

AB  - We present a comprehensive approach to using electronic medical records (EMR) for
      constructing contact networks of healthcare workers in a hospital. This approach 
      is applied at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics (UIHC)--a 3.2 million 
      square foot facility with 700 beds and about 8,000 healthcare workers--by
      obtaining 19.8 million EMR data points, spread over more than 21 months. We use
      these data to construct 9,000 different healthcare worker contact networks, which
      serve as proxies for patterns of actual healthcare worker contacts. Unlike
      earlier approaches, our methods are based on large-scale data and do not make any
      a priori assumptions about edges (contacts) between healthcare workers, degree
      distributions of healthcare workers, their assignment to wards, etc. Preliminary 
      validation using data gathered from a 10-day long deployment of a wireless sensor
      network in the Medical Intensive Care Unit suggests that EMR logins can serve as 
      realistic proxies for hospital-wide healthcare worker movement and contact
      patterns. Despite spatial and job-related constraints on healthcare worker
      movement and interactions, analysis reveals a strong structural similarity
      between the healthcare worker contact networks we generate and social networks
      that arise in other (e.g., online) settings. Furthermore, our analysis shows that
      disease can spread much more rapidly within the constructed contact networks as
      compared to random networks of similar size and density. Using the generated
      contact networks, we evaluate several alternate vaccination policies and conclude
      that a simple policy that vaccinates the most mobile healthcare workers first, is
      robust and quite effective relative to a random vaccination policy.

      health records.
PG  - e75214
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0075214 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most available quality indicators for hospitals are represented by
      simple ratios or proportions, and are limited to specific events. A generalized
      method that can be applied to diverse clinical events has not been developed. The
      aim of this study was to develop a simple method of evaluating physicians'
      prescription patterns for diverse events and their level of awareness of clinical
      practice guidelines. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We developed a quantitative method
      called Prescription pattern Around Clinical Event (PACE), which is applicable to 
      electronic health records (EHRs). Three discrete prescription patterns
      (intervention, maintenance, and discontinuation) were determined based on the
      prescription change index (PCI), which was calculated by means of the increase or
      decrease in the prescription rate after a clinical event. Hyperkalemia and
      Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) were used as example cases. We
      calculated the PCIs of 10 drugs related to hyperkalemia, categorized them into
      prescription patterns, and then compared the resulting prescription patterns with
      the known standards for hyperkalemia treatment. The hyperkalemia knowledge of
      physicians was estimated using a questionnaire and compared to the prescription
      pattern. Prescriptions for CDAD were also determined and compared to clinical
      knowledge. Clinical data of 1698, 348, and 1288 patients were collected from EHR 
      data. The physicians prescribing behaviors for hyperkalemia and CDAD were
      concordant with the standard knowledge. Prescription patterns were well
      correlated with individual physicians' knowledge of hyperkalemia (kappa = 0.714).
      Prescribing behaviors according to event severity or clinical condition were
      plotted as a simple summary graph. CONCLUSION: The algorithm successfully
      assessed the prescribing patterns from the EHR data. The prescription patterns
      were well correlated with physicians' knowledge. We expect that this algorithm
      will enable quantification of prescribers' adherence to clinical guidelines and
      be used to facilitate improved prescribing practices.

TI  - 3D visualization environment for analysis of telehealth indicators in public
      health.
PG  - 1152
AB  - With the growth of telehealth applications and the need for public health
      managers to have tools that facilitate visualization of indicators produced by
      telehealth services arose the need to have simple systems to better planning the 
      interventions. Furthermore, Health systems are considers difficult in order to
      visualize the right information by many health professionals [1] because of the
      complexity of its Graphical User Interface (GUI) and the high cognitive load
      needed to handle it. To overcome this problem, we have proposed a 3D environment 
      for the analysis of telehealth indicators in public health by managers of public 
      health sites. Users who will use the environment are part of public health
      manager of family health sites that participate of Network of Telehealth Centers 
      of Pernambuco (RedeNUTES) [2] that is part of Brazil telehealth program. This
      paper aims to present a 3D environment for analysis of telehealth indicators by
      public health manager.

TI  - Standardized drug and pharmacological class network construction.
PG  - 1125
AB  - Dozens of drug terminologies and resources capture the drug and/or drug class
      information, ranging from their coverage and adequacy of representation. No
      transformative ways are available to link them together in a standard way, which 
      hinders data integration and data representation for drug-related clinical and
      translational studies. In this paper, we introduce our preliminary work for
      building a standardized drug and drug class network that integrates multiple drug
      terminological resources, using Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) and
      National Drug File Reference Terminology (NDF-RT) as network backbone, and
      expanding with RxNorm and Structured Product Label (SPL). The network consists of
      39,728 drugs and drug classes. We calculated and compared structure similarity
      for each drug/drug class pair from ATC and NDF-RT, and analyzed constructed drug 
      class network from chemical structure perspective.

TI  - CiteGraph: a citation network system for MEDLINE articles and analysis.
PG  - 832-6
AB  - This paper details the development and implementation of CiteGraph, a system for 
      constructing large-scale citation and co-authorship networks from full-text
      biomedical articles. CiteGraph represents articles and authors by uniquely
      identified nodes, and connects those nodes through citation and co-authorship
      relations. CiteGraph network encompasses over 1.65 million full-text articles and
      6.35 million citations by 1.37 million unique authors from the Elsevier full-text
      articles. Our evaluation shows 98% 99% F1-score for mapping a citation to the
      corresponding article and identifying MEDLINE articles. We further analyzed the
      characteristics of CiteGraph and found that they are consistent with assumptions 
      made using small-scale bibliometric analysis. We also developed several novel
      network-based methods for analyzing publication, citation and collaboration
      patterns. This is the first work to develop a completely automated system for the
      creation of a large-scale citation network in the biomedical domain, and also to 
      introduce novel findings in researcher publication histories. CiteGraph can be a 
      useful resource to both the biomedical community, and bibliometric research.

TI  - User experience of interRAI assessment tools in New Zealand.
PG  - 744-8
AB  - The international residential assessment instrument (interRAI) has been adopted
      for phased national implementation in New Zealand. It targets people over 65
      years who require needs assessment for access to long term publicly funded
      services. There is limited research on the barriers to adoption for interRAI
      electronic assessment tools, and none relating to the New Zealand health sector. 
      This research qualitatively explored clinicians' perceptions and experience of
      using interRAI electronic assessment tools using semi-structured interviews
      guided by constructs from the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 
      (UTAUT) model [9]. Analysis was conducted using thematic analysis. Three major
      barriers to adoption of interRAI tools emerged from the research: 1) lack of
      ready access to individual laptops/computers with consistent network
      connectivity, 2) need for ongoing training for interRAI assessors, and, 3) lack
      of understanding of what information is being collected and for what reasons. The
      growth in aging populations will see greater use of interRAI electronic
      assessment tools, and therefore more clinicians required to learn and use the
      technology. Addressing these barriers to adoption is therefore vital.

TI  - Concepts for a standard based cross-organisational information security
      management system in the context of a nationwide EHR.
PG  - 548-52
AB  - Working with health related data necessitates appropriate levels of security and 
      privacy. Information security, meaning ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and
      availability, is more organizational, than technical in nature. It includes many 
      organizational and management measures, is based on well-defined security roles, 
      processes, and documents, and needs permanent adaption of security policies,
      continuously monitoring, and measures assessment. This big challenge for any
      organization leads to implementation of an information security management system
      (ISMS). In the context of establishing a regional or national electronic health
      record for integrated care (ICEHR), the situation is worse. Changing the medical 
      information exchange from on-demand peer-to-peer connections to health
      information networks requires all organizations participating in the EHR system
      to have consistent security levels and to follow the same security guidelines and
      rules. Also, the implementation must be monitored and audited, establishing
      cross-organizational information security management systems (ISMS) based on
      international standards. This paper evaluates requirements and defines basic
      concepts for an ISO 27000 series-based cross-organizational ISMS in the
      healthcare domain and especially for the implementation of the nationwide
      electronic health record in Austria (ELGA).

TI  - Routinely-collected general practice data from the electronic patient record and 
      general practitioner active electronic questioning method: a comparative study.
PG  - 510-4
AB  - The numerous existing primary care-based research networks currently use various 
      data collection methods. In this paper, we compared routine data extracted from
      general practitioners' (GPs') electronic patient records (EPRs) and GPs' answers 
      to an electronic questionnaire. We investigated for 10,307 Belgian patients 10
      healthcare conditions using clinical and biological parameters (cholesterol,
      blood pressure, and body mass index), diagnoses (hypertension, diabetes, and
      personal past cardiovascular event(s)), and drug prescriptions (antidiabetic
      drugs, aspirin, statins, and antihypertensive drugs). We found a relatively fair 
      agreement (Kappa>/=0.40) between the two data collection methods for 7 healthcare
      conditions, but no agreement for the biological parameters. When EPR data was
      used and compared with the questioning method, the prevalence of diagnoses and
      drug prescriptions was relatively lower and the prevalence of clinical and
      biological parameters was relatively higher (all missing data excluded) in the
      EPR data than in the data collected using the questioning method. Using EPR data,
      we calculated an acceptable proxy for the prevalence as observed using the
      questioning method. The comparison of the two data collection methods was a
      worthwhile approach, in that it could highlight potential ways to improve both
      care quality and information systems.

AB  - Clinical trial eligibility criteria define fine-grained characteristics of
      research volunteers for various disease trials and hence are a promising data
      source for disease profiling. This paper explores the feasibility of using
      disease-specific common eligibility features (CEFs) for representing diseases and
      understanding their relatedness. We extracted disease-specific CEFs from
      eligibility criteria on ClinicalTrials.gov for three illustrative categories -
      cancers, mental disorders and chronic diseases - each including seven diseases.
      We then constructed disease-specific CEF networks to assess the degree of overlap
      among the diseases. Using these automatically derived networks, we observed
      several findings that were confirmed in medicine. For example, we highlighted
      connections among schizophrenia, epilepsy and depression. We also identified a
      link between Crohn's disease and arthritis. These observations confirm the value 
      of using clinical trial eligibility criteria for identifying disease relatedness.
      We further discuss the implications of CEFs for standardizing clinical trial
      eligibility criteria through reuse.

      analysis for common reporting system in Japan.
PG  - 137-41
AB  - The analysis of medical incident reports is indispensable for patient safety.
      Most incident reports are composed from freely written descriptions, but an
      analysis of such free descriptions is not sufficient in the medical field. In
      this study, we aim to conduct new findings using incident information, to clarify
      improvements that should be made to solve the root cause of an accident, and to
      ensure safe medical treatment through such improvements. We employed natural
      language processing (NLP) and network analysis to identify effective classes of
      medical incident reports. Network analysis can find various relationships that
      are not only direct but also indirect. After that, we compared the clustering
      results between Jichi Medical University and Osaka City University Hospital. By
      finding the common and different parts in medical incident report' s classes, we 
      could show new perspectives on proposing a common reporting systems in Japan for 
      improving patient safety.

TI  - Consumers' online social network topologies and health behaviours.
PG  - 77-81
AB  - Personally controlled health management systems (PCHMS) often consist of multiple
      design features. Yet, they currently lack empirical evidence on how consumers use
      and engage with a PCHMS. An online prospective study was designed to investigate 
      how 709 consumers used a web-based PCHMS to manage their physical and emotional
      wellbeing over five months. The web-based PCHMS, Healthy.me, was developed at
      UNSW and incorporates an untethered personal health record, consumer care
      pathways, forums, polls, diaries, and messaging links with healthcare
      professionals. The two PCHMS features that consumers used most frequently, found 
      most useful, and engaging were the social features, i.e. forum and poll. Compared
      to participants who did not use any PCHMS social feature, those who used either
      the poll or the forum were 12.3% more likely to visit a healthcare professional
      (P=0.001) during the study. Social network analysis of forums revealed a spectrum
      of social interaction patterns - from question-and-answer structures to community
      discussions. This study provides a basis for understanding how a PCHMS can be
      used as a socially-driven intervention to influence consumers' health behaviours.

TI  - Empirical assessment of methods for risk identification in healthcare data:
      results from the experiments of the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership.
PG  - 4401-15
LID - 10.1002/sim.5620 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Expanded availability of observational healthcare data (both
      administrative claims and electronic health records) has prompted the development
      of statistical methods for identifying adverse events associated with medical
      products, but the operating characteristics of these methods when applied to the 
      real-world data are unknown. METHODS: We studied the performance of eight
      analytic methods for estimating of the strength of association-relative risk (RR)
      and associated standard error of 53 drug-adverse event outcome pairs, both
      positive and negative controls. The methods were applied to a network of ten
      observational healthcare databases, comprising over 130 million lives.
      Performance measures included sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive
      value of methods at RR thresholds achieving statistical significance of p < 0.05 
      or p < 0.001 and with absolute threshold RR > 1.5, as well as threshold-free
      measures such as area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).
      RESULTS: Although no specific method demonstrated superior performance, the
      aggregate results provide a benchmark and baseline expectation for risk
      identification method performance. At traditional levels of statistical
      significance (RR > 1, p < 0.05), all methods have a false positive rate >18%,
      with positive predictive value <38%. The best predictive model, high-dimensional 
      propensity score, achieved an AUC = 0.77. At 50% sensitivity, false positive rate
      ranged from 16% to 30%. At 10% false positive rate, sensitivity of the methods
      ranged from 9% to 33%. CONCLUSIONS: Systematic processes for risk identification 
      can provide useful information to supplement an overall safety assessment, but
      assessment of methods performance suggests a substantial chance of identifying
      false positive associations.

AB  - Along with the increasing adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) are
      expectations that data collected within EHRs will be readily available for
      outcomes and comparative effectiveness research. Yet the ability to effectively
      share and reuse data depends on implementing and configuring EHRs with these
      goals in mind from the beginning. Data sharing and integration must be planned
      both locally as well as nationally. The rich data transmission and semantic
      infrastructure developed by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) for research
      provides an excellent example of moving beyond paper-based paradigms and
      exploiting the power of semantically robust, network-based systems, and engaging 
      both domain and informatics expertise. Similar efforts are required to address
      current challenges in sharing EHR data.

TI  - Analysis of cloud-based solutions on EHRs systems in different scenarios.
PG  - 3777-82
LID - 10.1007/s10916-012-9850-2 [doi]
AB  - Nowadays with the growing of the wireless connections people can access all the
      resources hosted in the Cloud almost everywhere. In this context, organisms can
      take advantage of this fact, in terms of e-Health, deploying Cloud-based
      solutions on e-Health services. In this paper two Cloud-based solutions for
      different scenarios of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) management system are
      proposed. We have researched articles published between the years 2005 and 2011
      about the implementation of e-Health services based on the Cloud in Medline. In
      order to analyze the best scenario for the deployment of Cloud Computing two
      solutions for a large Hospital and a network of Primary Care Health centers have 
      been studied. Economic estimation of the cost of the implementation for both
      scenarios has been done via the Amazon calculator tool. As a result of this
      analysis two solutions are suggested depending on the scenario: To deploy a Cloud
      solution for a large Hospital a typical Cloud solution in which are hired just
      the needed services has been assumed. On the other hand to work with several
      Primary Care Centers it's suggested the implementation of a network, which
      interconnects these centers with just one Cloud environment. Finally it's
      considered the fact of deploying a hybrid solution: in which EHRs with images
      will be hosted in the Hospital or Primary Care Centers and the rest of them will 
      be migrated to the Cloud.

LID - 10.1186/1472-6963-12-402 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite numerous studies evaluating the benefits of Helicopter
      Emergency Medical Services (HEMS) in primary scene responses, little information 
      exists on the scope of HEMS activities in Australia. We describe HEMS primary
      scene responses with respect to the time taken, the distances travelled relative 
      to the closest designated trauma hospital and the receiving hospital; as well as 
      the clinical characteristics of patients attended. METHODS: Clinical service data
      were retrospectively obtained from three HEMS in New South Wales between July
      2008 and June 2009. All available primary scene response data were extracted and 
      examined. Geographic Information System (GIS) based network analysis was used to 
      estimate hypothetical ground transport distances from the locality of each
      primary scene response to firstly the closest designated trauma hospital and
      secondly the receiving hospital. Predictors of bypassing the closest designated
      trauma hospital were analysed using logistic regression. RESULTS: Analyses
      included 596 primary missions. Overall the HEMS had a median return trip time of 
      94min including a median of 9min for activation, 34min travelling to the scene,
      30min on-scene and 25min transporting patients to the receiving hospital. 72% of 
      missions were within 100km of the receiving hospital and 87% of missions were in 
      areas classified as 'major cities' or 'inner regional'. The majority of incidents
      attended by HEMS were trauma-related, with road trauma the predominant cause
      (44%). The majority of trauma patients (81%) had normal physiology at HEMS
      arrival (RTS = 7.84). We found 62% of missions bypassed the closest designated
      trauma hospital. Multivariate predictors of bypass included: age; presence of
      spinal or burns trauma; the level of the closest designated trauma hospital; the 
      transporting HEMS. CONCLUSION: Our results document the large distances travelled
      by HEMS in NSW, especially in rural areas. The high proportion of HEMS missions
      that bypass the closest designated trauma hospital is a seldom mentioned benefit 
      of HEMS transport. These results along with the characteristics of patients
      attended and the time HEMS take to complete primary scene responses are useful in
      understanding the benefit HEMS provides and the services it replaces.

      network of Santa Catarina.
PG  - 1023-30
LID - S0066-782X2012005000094 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A growing use of telemedicine has been observed, especially as
      regards the sending and evaluation of electrocardiograms (ECG); this is a
      low-cost procedure with a high potential to save lives. OBJECTIVES: To describe
      the form of systematic analysis and user profile of the Telemedicine Network of
      Santa Catarina during the time when the report was issued freely. METHODS:
      Observational cross-sectional study determining the associations between patient 
      characteristics and electrocardiographic diagnoses issued among users of the
      Telemedicine Network of Santa Catarina during the time when the report was issued
      freely. This system was connected to 287 cities in Santa Catarina; the tests were
      done in the places of origin and the reports were issued in three tertiary-care
      hospitals. From 2005 to 2010 the reports were issued freely and a probabilistic
      method for data analysis was created. An experienced cardiologist evaluated all
      ECGs to assess the chances of abnormality. RESULTS: 243,363 ECGs were evaluated. 
      The majority (58%) was performed on patients older than 50 years from primary
      care services (72%). There were differences in the frequency per region; this was
      partly related to the number of cardiologists/region (r = -0.551), to the
      distance from tertiary-care centers and potential differences of acceptance of
      the method. Approximately 53% of the ECGs were abnormal with greater frequency
      with increasing age (r(2) = 0.8166) and with significant regional differences (p 
      < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: We built a data analysis system integrating prevalent

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Physicians who more intensively interact with electronic health
      records (EHRs) through their documentation style may pay greater attention to
      coded fields and clinical decision support and thus may deliver higher quality
      care. We measured the quality of care of physicians who used three predominating 
      EHR documentation styles: dictation, structured documentation, and free text.
      METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of visits by patients with
      coronary artery disease and diabetes to the Partners Primary Care Practice Based 
      Research Network. The main outcome measures were 15 EHR-based coronary artery
      disease and diabetes measures assessed 30 days after primary care visits.
      RESULTS: During the 9-month study period, 7000 coronary artery disease and
      diabetes patients made 18 569 visits to 234 primary care physicians of whom 20
      (9%) predominantly dictated their notes, 68 (29%) predominantly used structured
      documentation, and 146 (62%) predominantly typed free text notes. In
      multivariable modeling adjusted for clustering by patient and physician, quality 
      of care appeared significantly worse for dictators than for physicians using the 
      other two documentation styles on three of 15 measures (antiplatelet medication, 
      tobacco use documentation, and diabetic eye exam); better for structured
      documenters for three measures (blood pressure documentation, body mass index
      documentation, and diabetic foot exam); and better for free text documenters on
      one measure (influenza vaccination). There was no measure for which dictators had
      higher quality of care than physicians using the other two documentation styles. 
      CONCLUSIONS: EHR-assessed quality is necessarily documentation-dependent, but
      physicians who dictated their notes appeared to have worse quality of care than
      physicians who used structured EHR documentation. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION

TI  - High density GWAS for LDL cholesterol in African Americans using electronic
      medical records reveals a strong protective variant in APOE.
PG  - 394-9
LID - 10.1111/j.1752-8062.2012.00446.x [doi]
AB  - Only one low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) genome-wide association
      study (GWAS) has been previously reported in -African Americans. We performed a
      GWAS of LDL-C in African Americans using data extracted from electronic medical
      records (EMR) in the eMERGE network. African Americans were genotyped on the
      Illumina 1M chip. All LDL-C measurements, prescriptions, and diagnoses of
      concomitant disease were extracted from EMR. We created two analytic datasets;
      one dataset having median LDL-C calculated after the exclusion of some lab values
      based on comorbidities and medication (n= 618) and another dataset having median 
      LDL-C calculated without any exclusions (n= 1,249). SNP rs7412 in APOE was
      strongly associated with LDL-C in both datasets (p < 5 x 10(-8) ). In the dataset
      with exclusions, a decrease of 20.0 mg/dL per minor allele was observed. The
      effect size was attenuated (12.3 mg/dL) in the dataset without any lab values
      excluded. Although other signals in APOE have been detected in previous GWAS,
      this large and important SNP association has not been well detected in large GWAS
      because rs7412 was not included on many genotyping arrays. Use of median LDL-C
      extracted from EMR after exclusions for medications and comorbidities increased
      the percentage of trait variance explained by genetic variation.

TI  - Implementing and evaluating electronic standing orders in primary care practice: 
      a PPRNet study.
PG  - 594-604
LID - 10.3122/jabfm.2012.05.110214 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A standing order (SO) authorizes nurses and other staff to carry out 
      medical orders per practice-approved protocol without a clinician's examination. 
      This study implemented electronic SOs into the daily workflow of primary care
      practices; identified methods and strategies; determined barriers and
      facilitators; and measured changes in quality indicators resulting from
      electronic SOs. METHODS: Within 8 practices using the Practice Partner(R)
      electronic health record (EHR), a customized health maintenance template provided
      SOs for screening, immunization, and diabetes measures. EHR data extracts were
      used to calculate the presence and use of these measures on health maintenance
      templates and performance over 21 months. Qualitative observation/interviews at
      practice site visits, network meetings, and correspondence enabled synthesis of
      implementation issues. RESULTS: Improvements in template presence, use, and
      performance were found for 14 measures across all practices. Median improvements 
      in screening ranged 6% to 10%; immunizations, 8% to 17%, and diabetes, 0% to 18%.
      Two practices achieved significant improvement on 14 of the 15 measures. All
      practices significantly improved on at least 3 of the measures. CONCLUSIONS: A
      small sample of primary care practices implemented SOs for screening,
      immunizations and diabetes measures supported by PPRNet researchers. Technical
      competence and leadership to adapt EHR reminder tools helped staff adopt new
      roles and overcome barriers.

TI  - Coreference resolution of medical concepts in discharge summaries by exploiting
      contextual information.
PG  - 888-96
LID - 10.1136/amiajnl-2012-000808 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Patient discharge summaries provide detailed medical information about
      hospitalized patients and are a rich resource of data for clinical record text
      mining. The textual expressions of this information are highly variable. In order
      to acquire a precise understanding of the patient, it is important to uncover the
      relationship between all instances in the text. In natural language processing
      (NLP), this task falls under the category of coreference resolution. DESIGN: A
      key contribution of this paper is the application of contextual-dependent rules
      that describe relationships between coreference pairs. To resolve phrases that
      refer to the same entity, the authors use these rules in three representative NLP
      systems: one rule-based, another based on the maximum entropy model, and the last
      a system built on the Markov logic network (MLN) model. RESULTS: The experimental
      results show that the proposed MLN-based system outperforms the baseline system
      (exact match) by average F-scores of 4.3% and 5.7% on the Beth and Partners
      datasets, respectively. Finally, the three systems were integrated into an
      ensemble system, further improving performance to 87.21%, which is 4.5% more than
      the official i2b2 Track 1C average (82.7%). CONCLUSION: In this paper, the main
      challenges in the resolution of coreference relations in patient discharge
      summaries are described. Several rules are proposed to exploit contextual
      information, and three approaches presented. While single systems provided
      promising results, an ensemble approach combining the three systems produced a
      better performance than even the best single system.

TI  - Evaluation of alternative standardized terminologies for medical conditions
      within a network of observational healthcare databases.
PG  - 689-96
LID - 10.1016/j.jbi.2012.05.002 [doi]
AB  - Large electronic databases of health care information, such as administrative
      claims and electronic health records, are available and are being used in a
      number of public health settings, including drug safety surveillance. However,
      because of a lack of standardization, clinical terminologies may differ across
      databases. With the aid of existing resources and expert coders, we have
      developed mapping tables to convert ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes used in some
      existing databases to SNOMED-CT and MedDRA. In addition, previously developed
      definitions for specific health outcomes of interest were mapped to the same
      standardized vocabularies. We evaluated how vocabulary mapping affected (1) the
      retention of clinical data from two test databases, (2) the semantic space of
      outcome definitions, (3) the prevalence of each outcome in the test databases,
      and (4) the reliability of analytic methods designed to detect drug-outcome
      associations in the test databases. Although vocabulary mapping affected the
      semantic space of some outcome definitions, as well as the prevalence of some
      outcomes in the test databases, it had only minor effects on the analysis of
      drug-outcome associations. Furthermore, both SNOMED-CT and MedDRA were viable for
      use as standardized vocabularies in systems designed to perform active medical
      product surveillance using disparate sources of observational data.

TI  - A simple approach to improve recording of concerns about child maltreatment in
      primary care records: developing a quality improvement intervention.
PG  - e478-86
LID - 10.3399/bjgp12X652346 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Information is lacking on how concerns about child maltreatment are
      recorded in primary care records. AIM: To determine how the recording of child
      maltreatment concerns can be improved. DESIGN AND SETTING: Development of a
      quality improvement intervention involving: clinical audit, a descriptive survey,
      telephone interviews, a workshop, database analyses, and consensus development in
      UK general practice. METHOD: Descriptive analyses and incidence estimates were
      carried out based on 11 study practices and 442 practices in The Health
      Improvement Network (THIN). Telephone interviews, a workshop, and a consensus
      development meeting were conducted with lead GPs from 11 study practices.
      RESULTS: The rate of children with at least one maltreatment-related code was
      8.4/1000 child years (11 study practices, 2009-2010), and 8.0/1000 child years
      (THIN, 2009-2010). Of 25 patients with known maltreatment, six had no
      maltreatment-related codes recorded, but all had relevant free text, scanned
      documents, or codes. When stating their reasons for undercoding maltreatment
      concerns, GPs cited damage to the patient relationship, uncertainty about which
      codes to use, and having concerns about recording information on other family
      members in the child's records. Consensus recommendations are to record the code 
      'child is cause for concern' as a red flag whenever maltreatment is considered,
      and to use a list of codes arranged around four clinical concepts, with an option
      for a templated short data entry form. CONCLUSION: GPs under-record
      maltreatment-related concerns in children's electronic medical records. As
      failure to use codes makes it impossible to search or audit these cases, an
      approach designed to be simple and feasible to implement in UK general practice
      was recommended.

TI  - Adverse drug reactions for CAM and conventional drugs detected in a network of
      physicians certified to prescribe CAM drugs.
PG  - 427-38
AB  - BACKGROUND: Within recent years, the increasing popularity of complementary and
      alternative medicine (CAM) has led health care authorities to focus on the safety
      of these drugs. One reason for the low awareness of adverse drug reactions (ADRs)
      associated with CAM might be that users and physicians believe that there are no 
      risks associated with CAM drugs. Recent studies have shown that ADRs are
      under-reported and are considered a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. The
      Evaluation of Anthroposophical Medicine (EvaMed) Pharmacovigilance Network was
      formed in 2004 at the Havelhoehe Research Institute in Berlin and is composed of 
      38 CAM physicians located in 12 of the 16 federal states in Germany for the
      purpose of using EvaMed data to evaluate the prescribing patterns, effectiveness,
      and safety of CAM therapies. OBJECTIVE: To describe and quantify the volume and
      severity of ADRs for CAM and conventional (CON) drugs in a proprietary database
      created from prescriptions and patient data of primary care CAM physicians who
      participate in the EvaMed Network. METHODS: This was a prospective, multicenter, 
      observational study based on the ADR reports and electronic prescription data of 
      38 individual physicians (21 general practitioners, 9 pediatricians, 4
      internists, 2 gynecologists, 1 dermatologist, and 1 neurologist) participating in
      the EvaMed Network. In addition to standard medical education, all physicians had
      5 years practical experience and an additional qualification for anthroposophic
      medicine, which is a subcategory of CAM. All 38 physicians documented ADRs deemed
      serious, defined as life threatening or resulting in death,
      disability/incapacity, or inpatient hospital days. Due to the time-consuming
      nature of documenting ADRs, only a subgroup of 7 physicians (4 in general
      practice and 1 each in internal medicine, pediatrics, and gynecology) agreed to
      report both nonserious and serious ADRs. Therefore, the incidence and frequency
      of ADRs were evaluated in this subgroup. The study period was January 2004
      through June 2009. ADRs were documented by the physicians using an electronic
      case report form in the EvaMed software, which was linked to the physicians'
      existing electronic medical record (EMR) systems and incorporated into their
      daily routines to avoid missing data or double entries. The participating
      physicians were compensated euro15 (approximately US$20) for each ADR report. All
      ADR reports were monitored at the Havelhoehe Research Institute by 2 physicians
      who evaluated patient characteristics, present visit diagnosis, target drugs,
      associated drug classes and type of drugs, type of ADR, actions taken for the
      ADR, and outcome of the ADR. RESULTS: There were 1,018,626 drugs (54.8% CAM)
      prescribed by the 38 physicians for 88,431 patients, and 412 ADRs reported for
      389 patients; 124 (30.1%) ADRs were for CAM drugs. The majority were reported in 
      children (69.2%, n = 285) and females (56.3%, n = 232). All serious ADRs (n = 14)
      were associated with CON drugs. In the subgroup of 7 physicians who agreed to
      report all ADRs, a total of 327 serious and nonserious ADRs were reported for
      392,243 prescribed drugs (0.08%) and for 308 of 25,966 patients (1.2%). ADRs were
      reported for 241 of 16,032 children (aged 17 years or younger; 1.5%) versus 67 of
      9,934 adults (0.7%). Of the 327 total ADRs, 10 (3.1%) were serious. There were 95
      ADRs for 213,900 CAM prescriptions (4.4 per 10,000) versus 232 for 178,343 CON
      prescriptions (13.0 per 10,000). The CAM drug with the highest frequency of ADRs 
      was Pelargonium sidoides root (0.21%, 4 of 1,940 prescriptions). The most
      frequently reported ingredient in CAM was ivy leaves with an ADR frequency of
      0.17% (n = 11 of 6,575 prescriptions). The most reported drug connected with ADRs
      was amoxicillin (1.36%, n = 31 of 2,276 prescriptions). The most common ADR
      medical management was withdrawal of the drug (82.3% overall, 83.9% CAM, 81.6%
      CON). CONCLUSIONS: A sample of 38 CAM physicians reported the occurrence of at
      least 1 ADR for 0.4% of treated patients in a 5.5-year study period. There were
      no serious ADRs reported for CAM drugs. In a subsample of 7 physicians who agreed
      to report all nonserious and serious ADRs, 1.2% of patients experienced at least 
      1 ADR; rates of ADRs per 10,000 prescriptions were 4.4 for CAM drugs and 13.0 for
      CON drugs.

TI  - Tables or bar graphs? Presenting test results in electronic medical records.
PG  - 545-53
LID - 10.1177/0272989X12441395 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Electronic personal health records offer a promising way to
      communicate medical test results to patients. We compared the usability of tables
      and horizontal bar graphs for presenting medical test results electronically.
      METHODS: We conducted experiments with a convenience sample of 106
      community-dwelling adults. In the first experiment, participants viewed either
      table or bar graph formats (between subjects) that presented medical test results
      with normal and abnormal findings. In a second experiment, participants viewed
      table and bar graph formats (within subjects) that presented test results with
      normal, borderline, and abnormal findings. RESULTS: Participants required less
      viewing time when using bar graphs rather than tables. This overall difference
      was due to superior performance of bar graphs in vignettes with many test
      results. Bar graphs and tables performed equally well with regard to recall
      accuracy and understanding. In terms of ease of use, participants did not prefer 
      bar graphs to tables when they viewed only one format. When participants viewed
      both formats, those with experience with bar graphs preferred bar graphs, and
      those with experience with tables found bar graphs equally easy to use.
      Preference for bar graphs was strongest when viewing tests with borderline
      results. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to horizontal bar graphs, tables required more
      time and experience to achieve the same results, suggesting that tables can be a 
      more burdensome format to use. The current practice of presenting medical test
      results in a tabular format merits reconsideration.

TI  - Associating clinical archetypes through UMLS Metathesaurus term clusters.
PG  - 1249-58
LID - 10.1007/s10916-010-9586-9 [doi]
AB  - Clinical archetypes are modular definitions of clinical data, expressed using
      standard or open constraint-based data models as the CEN EN13606 and openEHR.
      There is an increasing archetype specification activity that raises the need for 
      techniques to associate archetypes to support better management and user
      navigation in archetype repositories. This paper reports on a computational
      technique to generate tentative archetype associations by mapping them through
      term clusters obtained from the UMLS Metathesaurus. The terms are used to build a
      bipartite graph model and graph connectivity measures can be used for deriving
      associations.

TI  - Novel approach to utilizing electronic health records for dermatologic research: 
      developing a multi-institutional federated data network for clinical and
      translational research in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.
PG  - 2
AB  - The implementation of Electronic Health Records (EHR) in the United States has
      created new opportunities for research using automated data extraction methods. A
      large amount of information from the EHR can be utilized for clinical and
      translational research. To date, a number of institutions have the capability of 
      extracting clinical data from EHR to create local repositories of de-identified
      data amenable to research queries through the Informatics for Integrated Biology 
      and the Bedside (i2b2) platform. Collaborations among institutions sharing a
      common i2b2 platform hold exciting opportunities for research in psoriasis and
      psoriatic arthritis. With the automated extraction of patient-level data from
      multiple institutions, this novel informatics network has the ability to address 
      high-priority research questions. With commitment to high-quality data through
      applied algorithms for cohort identification and validation of outcomes, the
      creation of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis Integrated Research Data Network
      (PIONEER) will make a significant contribution to psoriasis and psoriatic
      arthritis research.

TI  - Automated interviews on clinical case reports to elicit directed acyclic graphs.
PG  - 1-11
LID - 10.1016/j.artmed.2011.11.007 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Setting up clinical reports within hospital information systems makes 
      it possible to record a variety of clinical presentations. Directed acyclic
      graphs (Dags) offer a useful way of representing causal relations in clinical
      problem domains and are at the core of many probabilistic models described in the
      medical literature, like Bayesian networks. However, medical practitioners are
      not usually trained to elicit Dag features. Part of the difficulty lies in the
      application of the concept of direct causality before selecting all the causal
      variables of interest for a specific patient. We designed an automated interview 
      to tutor medical doctors in the development of Dags to represent their
      understanding of clinical reports. METHODS: Medical notions were analyzed to find
      patterns in medical reasoning that can be followed by algorithms supporting the
      elicitation of causal Dags. Clinical relevance was defined to help formulate only
      relevant questions by driving an expert's attention towards variables causally
      related to nodes already inserted in the graph. Key procedural features of the
      proposed interview are described by four algorithms. RESULTS: The automated
      interview comprises questions on medical notions, phrased in medical terms. The
      first elicitation session produces questions concerning the patient's chief
      complaints and the outcomes related to diseases serving as diagnostic hypotheses,
      their observable manifestations and risk factors. The second session focuses on
      questions that refine the initial causal paths by considering syndromes,
      dysfunctions, pathogenic anomalies, biases and effect modifiers. A case study
      concerning a gastro-enterological problem and one dealing with an infected
      patient illustrate the output produced by the algorithms, depending on the
      answers provided by the doctor. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed elicitation framework
      is characterized by strong consistency with medical background and by a
      progressive introduction of relevant medical topics. Revision and testing of the 
      subjectively elicited Dag is performed by matching the collected answers with the
      evidence included in accepted sources of biomedical knowledge.

AB  - PURPOSE: A successful online presence is an important key factor in the
      competition among hospitals today. However, little is known about the internet
      presence and the quality of websites of burn units on the World Wide Web. The aim
      was to assess the online presence of hospitals provided by specialized burn units
      in German speaking countries with a focus on the rate and the performance of
      actively run websites. METHODS: A multicenter, observational, cross-sectional
      study was performed over a period of 1.5 month (October-December 2010).
      Forty-four burn units were assessed by using a previously generated criteria
      list. The list included 36 criteria with following topics: "research and
      teaching"; "patient care"; "clinical emphases", "general information";
      "information brokerage". RESULTS: Overall, the websites examined offered a good
      overview about their different online services with many multimedia-based
      elements included. All websites consisted of hyperlinks, general multimedia-based
      elements and information on means of communication with the hospital,
      respectively. In contrast, the quality of specific information for burn patients 
      was relatively poor. With regard to the need of elderly people, the usability and
      the layout, the different websites offer a lot of options for future
      improvements. CONCLUSION: Burn centers in Germany, Austria and Switzerland
      already consider the World Wide Web as an important tool for self-promotion and
      communication. The potential of burn center websites to function as a knowledge
      base for first aid as well as preventive measurements should be considered and
      realized in future web site designs.

TI  - Commentary: Lost in translation? How electronic health records structure
      communication, relationships, and meaning.
PG  - 392-4
LID - 10.1097/ACM.0b013e318248e5ae [doi]
AB  - The media through which we communicate shape how we think, how we act, and who we
      are. Electronic health records (EHRs) may promote more effective, efficient,
      coordinated, safer care. Research is emerging, but more is needed to assess the
      effect of EHRs on communication, relationships, patients' trust, adherence, and
      health outcomes. The authors posit that EHRs introduce a "third party" into exam 
      room interactions that competes with the patient for clinicians' attention,
      affects clinicians' capacity to be fully present, and alters the nature of
      communication, relationships, and physicians' sense of professional role.
      Screen-driven communication inhibits patients' narratives and diminishes
      clinicians' responses to patients' cues about psychosocial issues and emotional
      concerns. Students, trainees, and clinicians can, however, learn to integrate
      EHRs into triadic exam room interactions to facilitate information sharing and
      shared decision making.Student exposure to EHRs is currently limited. Educators
      and researchers should implement curricula and assessment tools to help learners 
      integrate EHRs into clinical interactions in ways that foster, rather than
      diminish, communication and relationships. Further, educators must prioritize the
      teaching and modeling of self-awareness and self-calibration, mindful presence,
      and compassion within such curricula to prevent these important qualities and
      skills from being lost in translation in the digital era.

      and expectations.
PG  - 23
LID - 10.1186/1472-6947-12-23 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Medical professionals go online for literature searches and
      communication with families.We administered a questionnaire to members of the
      Italian Society of Pediatrics to assess determinants of their use of the
      Internet, of social platforms and of personal health records during clinical
      practice. METHODS: All the 9180 members of the Italian Society of Pediatrics were
      invited to fill in a questionnaire concerning use of the Internet and usefulness 
      of Internet-based tools during clinical practice. The questionnaire was
      administered through the SurveyMonkey(R) web platform. Logistic regression
      analysis was used to study factors affecting use and influence of the Internet in
      clinical practice. RESULTS: A total of 1335 (14.5%) members returned the
      questionnaire. Mean age was 49.2 years, 58.6% were female. 32.3% had access to
      the Internet through a Smartphone. 71.9% of respondents used the Internet during 
      clinical practice, mainly searching for guidelines and drug references. Use of
      the Internet during clinical practice was more frequent among younger
      pediatricians (OR 0.964; 95% CI 0.591-0.978), males (OR 1.602; 95% CI
      1.209-2.123) and those living in Northern and Central Italy (OR 1.441; 95% CI
      1.111-1.869), while it was lower among family pediatricians. 94.6% of respondents
      were influenced in their clinical practice by information found on the Internet, 
      in particular younger pediatricians (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.932-0.989), hospital
      pediatricians (OR 2.929, 95% CI 1.708-5.024), and other pediatric profiles (OR
      6.143, 95%CI 1.848-20.423). 15.9% of respondents stated that social networks may 
      be useful in pediatric practice. Slightly more than half (50.5%) of respondents
      stated that personal health records may be clinically relevant. Registrars and
      hospital pediatricians were more likely to perceive personal health records as
      useful tools for clinical practice. Additional resources pediatricians would like
      to access were free bibliographic databases and tools for interacting with
      families. CONCLUSIONS: Italian pediatricians frequently use the Internet during
      their practice. One-third of them access the Internet through a Smartphone.
      Interaction with families and their empowerment can be improved by the use of
      Internet tools, including personal health records, toward which respondents show 
      a significant interest. Though, they show a general resistance to the
      introduction of social networks in clinical practice.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study explores the functional and structural patterns of
      connectivity underlying working memory impairment after severe traumatic axonal
      injury. METHODS: We performed an fMRI n-back task and acquired diffusion tensor
      images (DTI) in a group of 19 chronic-stage patients with severe traumatic brain 
      injury (TBI) and evidence of traumatic axonal injury and 19 matched healthy
      controls. We performed image analyses with FSL software and fMRI data were
      analyzed using probabilistic independent component analysis. Fractional
      anisotropy (FA) maps from DTI images were analyzed with FMRIB's Diffusion
      Toolbox. RESULTS: We identified working memory and default mode networks. Global 
      FA values correlated with both networks and FA whole-brain analysis revealed
      correlations in several tracts associated with the functional activation.
      Furthermore, working memory performance in the patient group correlated with the 
      functional activation patterns and with the FA values of the associative
      fasciculi. CONCLUSION: Combining structural and functional neuroimaging data, we 
      were able to describe structural white matter changes related to functional
      network alterations and to lower performance in working memory in chronic TBI.

TI  - Structured electronic operative reporting: comparison with dictation in kidney
      cancer surgery.
PG  - 182-91
LID - 10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2011.11.008 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the functionality of eKidney
      as a structured reporting tool in operative note generation. To do this, we
      compared completeness and timeliness of eKidney template-generated nephrectomy OR
      notes with standard narrative dictation. METHODS: A group of academic
      uro-oncologists and medical informaticians at the University Health Network
      designed and adopted an electronic online, point-of-care clinical documentation
      tool, eCancerCare(Kidney) (eKidney) for kidney cancer patient care. The optimal
      components of clinic and operative note templates, including those for
      nephrectomy, were agreed upon by expert consensus of the uro-oncologists.
      Clinician nephrectomy OR reports were analyzed for completeness, comparing those 
      generated in eKidney with conventionally dictated notes. Patterns of missing
      information from both dictated and eKidney-generated reports were analyzed. The
      procedure, note completion and transcription dates were recorded which generated 
      time intervals between these events. The records of 189 procedures were included 
      in the analysis. RESULTS: Comparison of clinicians who used both note generation 
      modalities, revealed a mean completion rate of 92% for eKidney/structured notes
      and 68% for dictated notes (p<0.0001). There was no significant difference in
      completion rates between attending staff and trainees (residents and fellows)
      (p=0.131). Most notes were dictated/entered on the day of surgery. Dictated notes
      were transcribed to EPR a median of 2 days after dictation, however roughly 30%
      of dictated notes took 5 days or more to get transcribed. All notes generated
      using eKidney were uploaded to the EPR immediately. LIMITATIONS: Our study has
      three significant limitations. Firstly, our study was not randomized: physicians 
      could elect to dictate or use eKidney. Secondly, we did not identify data from
      dictated notes that were not captured by eKidney. Third, we did not compare the
      time it took physicians to complete the fields in eKidney with the time it takes 
      to dictate a note. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated that the use of structured
      reporting improves the completeness and timeliness of documentation in kidney
      cancer surgery. eKidney is an example of the power of templates in ensuring that 
      important details of a procedure are recorded. Future studies looking at user
      satisfaction, and research and educational potential of eKidney would be
      valuable.

PG  - 84-91
LID - 10.1111/j.1708-8305.2011.00587.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) introduced a 
      program of registration, training, standards, and audit for yellow fever
      vaccination centers (YFVCs) in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland (EWNI) in
      2005. Prior to rolling out the program, NaTHNaC surveyed YFVCs in England.
      OBJECTIVES: To reassess the practice of YFVCs in 2009, 4 years after the
      institution of the NaTHNaC program, to identify areas for ongoing support, and to
      assess the impact of the program. METHODS: In 2009, all YFVCs in EWNI were asked 
      to complete a questionnaire on type of practice, administration of travel
      vaccines, staff training, vaccine storage and patient record keeping, use of
      travel health information, evaluation of NaTHNaC yellow fever (YF) training, and 
      resource and training needs. Data were analyzed using Microsoft Excel(R) and
      STATA 9(R). RESULTS: The questionnaire was completed by 1,438 YFVCs (41.5% of
      3,465 YFVCs). Most YFVCs were based in General Practice (87.4%). In nearly all
      YFVCs (97.0%), nurses advised travelers and administered YF vaccine. An annual
      median of 50 doses of YF vaccine was given by each YFVC. A total of 96.7% of
      nurses had received training in travel medicine, often through study days run by 
      vaccine manufacturers. The internet was frequently used for information during
      travel consultations (84.8%) and NaTHNaC's on-line and telephone advice resources
      were highly rated. Following YF training, 95.8% of attendees expressed improved
      confidence regarding YF vaccination issues. There was excellent adherence to
      vaccination standards: >/= 94% correctly stored vaccines, recorded refrigerator
      temperatures, and maintained YF vaccination records. CONCLUSIONS: In the 4 years 
      since institution of the NaTHNaC program for YFVCs, there has been improved
      adherence to basic standards of immunization practice and increased confidence of
      health professionals in YF vaccination. The NaTHNaC program could be a model for 
      other national public health bodies, as they establish a program for YF centers.

TI  - Ethical considerations in internet use of electronic protected health
      information.
PG  - 34-41
AB  - Caregivers, patients, and their family members are increasingly reliant on social
      network websites for storing, communicating, and referencing medical information.
      The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule
      seeks balance by protecting the privacy of patients' health information and
      assuring that this information is available to those who need it to provide
      health care. Though federal and state governments have created laws and policies 
      to safeguard patient privacy and confidentiality, the laws are inadequate against
      the rapid and innovative use of electronic health websites. As Internet use
      broadens access to information, health professionals must be aware that this
      information is not always secure. We must identify and reflect on medical ethics 
      issues and be accountable for maintaining privacy for the patient.

TI  - Transplantation with positive complement-dependent microcytotoxicity crossmatch
      in contemporary kidney transplantation: Practice patterns and associated
      outcomes.
PG  - 234-45
AB  - We analyzed clinical factors and graft survival associated with
      complement-dependent microcytotoxicity (CDC) crossmatch (XM) positive (+) kidney 
      transplants in 1995 to 2009 United Network of Sharing (UNOS) registry data. CDCXM
      negative (-) transplants were selected from centers and years in which at least
      one CDCXM+ transplant was performed at a given center in a given year. CDCXM+ and
      CDCXM- results were compared with bivariate and multivariate survival analysis.
      Our observations are as follows: (1) The risk of graft loss with CDCXM+ vs.
      CDCXM- results was markedly lower than the risk observed historically, e.g.,
      living donor (LD)-CDCXM+ absolute all-cause graft survival reductions were 0.7%
      at 24 hours (P=0.007), 2.9% at one year (P <0.0001), 3.7% at five years
      (P<0.0001); deceased donor (DD)-CDCXM+ absolute graft survival reductions were
      0.7% at 24 hours (P=0.02), 3.5% at one year (P <0.0001), 2.7% at five years
      (P=0.0009). On covariate adjustment, the only significant association of CDCXM+
      vs. CDCXM- results was with one-year graft loss risk: LD aHR 1.44 (95% CI
      1.05-1.96), DD aHR 1.33 (CI 1.10-1.61). (2) CDCXM+ transplantation was more
      commonly performed among groups disadvantaged with respect to transplant access, 
      including sensitized, previously transplanted women and black recipients. (3) In 
      CDCXM+ recipients, there was a high percentage of flow cytometry (FC) XM- and
      autoXM+ results. After removing these groups, outcomes with CDCXM+ results were
      relatively good. (4) CDCXM+/FCXM+ vs. CDCXM-/FCXM- graft loss risk was observed
      only in LD recipients transplanted at centers performing fewer than 10 such
      transplants during the study period: 11.0% reduction (P<0.0001) and aHR of 2.86
      (CI 1.18-6.94) at one year; 14.7% reduction (P<0.0001) and aHR of 1.77 (CI
      0.88-3.58) at five years. Although using CDCXM+ as a contraindication to
      transplantation has been associated with virtual elimination of hyperacute
      rejection, the negative effect of a CDCXM+ in contemporary practice is relatively
      small, questioning the value of the CDCXM as a standalone test.

TI  - Monitoring adverse drug reactions across a nationwide health care system using
      information technology.
PG  - 321-8
LID - 10.2146/ajhp110026 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The improvement and linkage of two Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
      databases for monitoring adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are described, with a
      discussion of the potential implications for improved medication safety within
      the VA health care system. SUMMARY: Before 2007, VA had limited capability to
      track and evaluate ADRs across its nationwide network of health care facilities. 
      Since then, VA has established a standardized monitoring system that has improved
      the reporting, analysis, and trending of ADRs reported by providers and
      pharmacists at individual VA facilities. The enhanced system has two components
      with distinct but complementary functions: the Adverse Reaction Tracking
      database, which is derived by extracting text-based, patient-specific information
      entered into the VA electronic medical record system by clinicians at the point
      of care; and the VA Adverse Drug Event Reporting System (VA ADERS), an external
      web-based portal that contains aggregated data from 146 VA facilities, with
      standardized coding of reported events. Both databases allow for ADR reporting at
      the local, regional, and national levels. The VA ADERS database permits rapid
      electronic reporting of certain ADRs to the federal MedWatch program. The two
      databases can be used in tandem for more comprehensive assessments of ADR
      patterns and reporting rates and to generate a wide range of benchmarking data.
      CONCLUSION: In recent years, the refinement of two databases for ADR reporting
      has increased VA's capability to systematically monitor, track, and report ADRs
      across its national network of health care facilities. Linking the two databases 
      has further strengthened those capabilities, enhancing medication safety
      practices and aiding in pharmacovigilance.

      affect a hospital's ability to perform?
PG  - 136-45
LID - 10.1016/j.healthpol.2011.07.010 [doi]
AB  - This study investigates whether inclusion of patient profiles impacts on the
      inferences drawn from measuring performance using patient level data. Performance
      is in this setting defined by resources used in treating patients in a given
      diagnose related group where use of resources is approximated by length of stay
      (LOS). The analysis is based on Danish registry data from 2006. Patient data
      include registry data on income, employment status and information on whether the
      patient receives benefits or lives alone. Considerable variation in the
      socio-demographic characteristics of patients across Danish hospitals was
      observed, and some patient characteristics were shown to drive the need for
      longer hospital stays beyond what is captured in DRG scores. Ranking of hospitals
      based on observed versus expected LOS remained largely unaffected when
      controlling for patient characteristics, suggesting that variation in LOS across 
      hospitals is mainly driven by other factors than patients' socio-demographic
      characteristics. Nevertheless, the results of this study indicate that the
      current Danish remuneration system discriminates hospitals that more often serve 
      older patients and patients with a less developed social network. These hospitals
      tend to have a reduced turnover of patients and their ability to generate revenue
      is therefore constrained.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine whether physician social networks are associated with
      variation in treatment for men with localized prostate cancer. DATA SOURCE:
      2004-2005 Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare data from three
      cities. STUDY DESIGN: We identified the physicians who care for patients with
      prostate cancer and created physician networks for each city based on shared
      patients. Subgroups of urologists were defined as physicians with dense
      connections with one another via shared patients. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Subgroups
      varied widely in their unadjusted rates of prostatectomy and the racial/ethnic
      and socioeconomic composition of their patients. There was an association between
      urologist subgroup and receipt of prostatectomy. In city A, four subgroups had
      significantly lower odds of prostatectomy compared with the subgroup with the
      highest rates of prostatectomy after adjusting for patient clinical and
      sociodemographic characteristics. Similarly, in cities B and C, subgroups had
      significantly lower odds of prostatectomy compared with the baseline.
      CONCLUSIONS: Using claims data to identify physician networks may provide an
      insight into the observed variation in treatment patterns for men with prostate
      cancer.

PG  - 129-36
LID - 10.1016/j.jacr.2011.10.010 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to assess whether an integrated imaging
      computerized physician order entry (CPOE) system with embedded decision support
      for imaging can be accepted clinically. METHODS: The study was performed in a
      health care delivery network with an affiliated academic hospital. After pilot
      testing and user feedback, a Web-enabled CPOE system with embedded imaging
      decision support was phased into clinical use between 2000 and 2010 across
      outpatient, emergency department, and inpatient settings. The primary outcome
      measure was meaningful use, defined as the proportion of imaging studies
      performed with orders electronically created (EC) or electronically signed by an 
      authorized provider. The secondary outcome measure was adoption, defined as the
      proportion of imaging studies that were ordered electronically, irrespective of
      who entered the order in the CPOE system. Univariate and multivariate regression 
      analyses were performed to estimate trends and the significance of practice
      settings, examination modality, and body part to outcome measures. Chi-square
      statistics were used to assess differences across specialties. RESULTS: A total
      of 4.1 million imaging studies were performed during the study period. From 2000 
      to 2010, significant increases in meaningful use (for EC studies, from 0.4% to
      61.9%; for electronically signed studies, from 0.4% to 92.2%; P < .005) and the
      adoption of CPOE (from 0.5% to 94.6%, P < .005) were observed. The use of EC
      studies was greatest in the emergency department and inpatient settings.
      Meaningful use varied across specialties; surgical subspecialties had the lowest 
      rates of EC studies. CONCLUSIONS: Imaging CPOE with embedded decision support
      integrated into the IT infrastructure of the health care enterprise and
      clinicians' workflow can be broadly accepted clinically.

PG  - 152-60
LID - 10.1097/MLR.0b013e31822dcef7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is substantial variation in the cost and intensity of care
      delivered by US hospitals. We assessed how the structure of patient-sharing
      networks of physicians affiliated with hospitals might contribute to this
      variation. METHODS: We constructed hospital-based professional networks based on 
      patient-sharing ties among 61,461 physicians affiliated with 528 hospitals in 51 
      hospital referral regions in the US using Medicare data on clinical encounters
      during 2006. We estimated linear regression models to assess the relationship
      between measures of hospital network structure and hospital measures of spending 
      and care intensity in the last 2 years of life. RESULTS: The typical physician in
      an average-sized urban hospital was connected to 187 other doctors for every 100 
      Medicare patients shared with other doctors. For the average-sized urban hospital
      an increase of 1 standard deviation (SD) in the median number of connections per 
      physician was associated with a 17.8% increase in total spending, in addition to 
      17.4% more hospital days, and 23.8% more physician visits (all P<0.001). In
      addition, higher "centrality" of primary care providers within these hospital
      networks was associated with 14.7% fewer medical specialist visits (P<0.001) and 
      lower spending on imaging and tests (-9.2% and -12.9% for 1 SD increase in
      centrality, P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Hospital-based physician network structure has
      a significant relationship with an institution's care patterns for their
      patients. Hospitals with doctors who have higher numbers of connections have
      higher costs and more intensive care, and hospitals with primary care-centered
      networks have lower costs and care intensity.

PG  - 950-9
AB  - We examined the content of electronically mediated communications in a trial of
      shared care planning (SCP) for long-term condition management. Software supports 
      SCP by sharing patient records and care plans among members of the
      multidisciplinary care team (with patient access). Our analysis focuses on a
      three-month period with 73 enrolled patients, 149 provider-assigned tasks, 64
      clinical notes and 48 care plans with 162 plan elements. Results show that
      content of notes entries is often related to task assignment and that nurses are 
      the most active users. Directions for refinement of the SCP technology are
      indicated, including better integration of notes, tasks and care team
      notifications, as well as the central role of nurses for design use cases.
      Broader issues are raised about workforce roles and responsibilities for SCP,
      integrating patient-provider and provider-provider communications, and the
      centrality of care plans as the key entity in mediation of the care team.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to identify the organizational factors
      that influence electronic health information exchange (HIE) by medical group
      practices in rural areas. METHODS: A purposive sample of 8 small medical group
      practices in 3 experimental HIE regions were interviewed to determine the extent 
      of clinical information exchange with other health care providers and to identify
      the factors influencing those patterns. FINDINGS: HIE was found to be largely
      limited to exchanging immunization data through the state health department and
      exchanging clinical information within owned provider systems. None of the
      clinics directly exchange clinical information with non-owned clinics or
      hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: While regional HIE networks may be a laudable goal,
      progress is slow and significant technical, political, and financial obstacles
      remain. Limiting factors include data protection concerns, competition among
      providers, costs, and lack of compatible electronic health record (EHR) systems.

PG  - 383-400
LID - 10.1007/978-1-62703-071-7_20 [doi]
AB  - Translational bioinformatics plays an indispensable role in transforming
      psychoneuroimmunology (PNI) into personalized medicine. It provides a powerful
      method to bridge the gaps between various knowledge domains in PNI and systems
      biology. Translational bioinformatics methods at various systems levels can
      facilitate pattern recognition, and expedite and validate the discovery of
      systemic biomarkers to allow their incorporation into clinical trials and outcome
      assessments. Analysis of the correlations between genotypes and phenotypes
      including the behavioral-based profiles will contribute to the transition from
      the disease-based medicine to human-centered medicine. Translational
      bioinformatics would also enable the establishment of predictive models for
      patient responses to diseases, vaccines, and drugs. In PNI research, the
      development of systems biology models such as those of the neurons would play a
      critical role. Methods based on data integration, data mining, and knowledge
      representation are essential elements in building health information systems such
      as electronic health records and computerized decision support systems. Data
      integration of genes, pathophysiology, and behaviors are needed for a broad range
      of PNI studies. Knowledge discovery approaches such as network-based systems
      biology methods are valuable in studying the cross-talks among pathways in
      various brain regions involved in disorders such as Alzheimer's disease.

      tool with the aim to integrate clinical and research data in order to support
      translational research in cardiology. In this work we describe the implementation
      and the customization of i2b2 to manage the data of arrhytmogenic disease
      patients collected at the Fondazione Salvatore Maugeri of Pavia in a joint
      project with the NYU Langone Medical Center (New York, USA). The i2b2 clinical
      research chart data warehouse is populated with the data obtained by the research
      database called TRIAD. The research infrastructure is extended by the development
      of new plug-ins for the i2b2 web client application able to properly select and
      export phenotypic data and to perform data analysis.

TI  - Self-Tracking, Social Media and Personal Health Records for Patient Empowered
      Self-Care. Contribution of the IMIA Social Media Working Group.
PG  - 16-24
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This paper explores the range of self-tracking devices and social
      media platforms used by the self-tracking community, and examines the
      implications of widespread adoption of these tools for scientific progress in
      health informatics. METHODS: A literature review was performed to investigate the
      use of social media and self-tracking technologies in the health sector. An
      environmental scan identified a range of products and services which were used to
      exemplify three levels of self-tracking: self-experimentation, social sharing of 
      data and patient controlled electronic health records. RESULTS: There appears to 
      be an increase in the use of self-tracking tools, particularly in the health and 
      fitness sector, but also used in the management of chronic diseases. Evidence of 
      efficacy and effectiveness is limited to date, primarily due to the health and
      fitness focus of current solutions as opposed to their use in disease management.
      CONCLUSIONS: Several key technologies are converging to produce a trend of
      increased personal health surveillance and monitoring, social connectedness and
      sharing, and integration of regional and national health information systems.
      These trends are enabling new applications of scientific techniques, from
      personal experimentation to e-epidemiology, as data gathered by individuals are
      aggregated and shared across increasingly connected healthcare networks. These
      trends also raise significant new ethical and scientific issues that will need to
      be addressed, both by health informatics researchers and the communities of
      self-trackers themselves.

TI  - Disparities in blood pressure control within a community-based provider network: 
      an exploratory analysis.
PG  - 1473-82
LID - 10.1345/aph.1Q523 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite treatment for hypertension, blood pressure (BP) remains
      uncontrolled in many individuals. Identification of patterns in BP control may
      inform strategies to improve treatment and optimize health outcomes. OBJECTIVE:
      To examine patterns in BP control among individuals receiving antihypertensive
      treatment in a diverse, community-based provider network. METHODS: In this
      retrospective exploratory analysis, a total of 51,772 hypertensive subjects were 
      identified in the electronic medical record between January 1, 2007, and June 30,
      2010, who were aged 18 years or older, with 2 or more claims for antihypertensive
      medication, documented race/ethnicity, and 1 or more documented BP readings.
      RESULTS: On the basis of Joint National Committee VII guidelines, 76.4% of
      nondiabetic patients had their BP controlled with treatment (<140/90 mm Hg) and
      52.3% of those with diabetes had their BP controlled with treatment (<130/80 mm
      Hg). The overall rate of BP control was 71.4%. Factors associated with controlled
      BP included younger age, lower disease burden, better medication adherence, fewer
      concurrent prescriptions, lower prescription copayments, and living in a region
      with a higher median household income. Furthermore, when adjusting for age, sex, 
      and disease burden, black (OR 0.68; 95% CI 0.62 to 0.75; p < 0.001), Hispanic (OR
      0.80; 95% CI 0.74 to 0.86; p < 0.001), and other race/ethnic group (OR 0.81; 95% 
      CI 0.70 to 0.94; p = 0.005) individuals were less likely than white individuals
      to have their treated BP controlled. Among nondiabetic hypertensive subjects with
      controlled BP, the most frequently prescribed therapy was a beta-blocker or an
      angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor across race/ethnicities; however,
      those who were black were most frequently prescribed a diuretic or calcium
      channel blocker. Among diabetic patients with controlled BP, the most frequently 
      prescribed therapy was an ACE inhibitor, regardless of race/ethnicity.
      CONCLUSIONS: Potential disparities, particularly among diabetic individuals and
      those of minority race/ethnicity, were found with regard to BP control and the
      agents used to treat hypertension. Future studies should address these
      disparities by designing interventions to improve the treatment of hypertension
      in high-risk populations.

TI  - [Do general practitioners identify iatrogenic in their medical records? Study of 
      2,380 cases of iatrogenic statements by French general practitioners].
PG  - 1418-22
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The only few data on non hospital iatrogeny stress its frequency and
      its scarce recording. We can wonder if general practioners identify it in their
      medical records and if the data collected are sufficient enough to describe it.
      METHODS: This transversal descriptive study was done on a 35-month period among a
      network of 112 GPs who steadily collected data. They used a thesaurus of
      diagnosis with definitions, the Dictionnaire des Resultats de Consultation. In
      addition to the diagnosis of iatrogeny, the 15 variables studied focused on the
      following characteristics: doctors, patients, consultations, adverse reactions
      and treatments. RESULTS: At least one diagnosis of iatrogeny was found for 42%
      GPs, which gives an average of 17 iatrogenic cases in a year (0.81%). The 1,899
      patients concerned presented 2,380 cases of iatrogeny and are women in majority
      (sex ratio: 0.7). The most common age bracket is the 50 to 59 years old persons. 
      The most frequent adverse reactions are: gastroenterology (26.9%), neurology
      (14.6%) and finally dermatology (14.2%). The 1,762 treatments recorded concern
      the cardiovascular system (14.2%), the neurologic system (23.3%), and
      anti-infectious treatments (2.3%). The physicians are the ones who prescribed the
      suspicious treatments for two thirds of the cases and automedication counts for
      1.7%. CONCLUSION: One GP out of two collects iatrogeny. Thanks to the information
      contained in the structured computerized medical record, we are able to analyse
      it accurately. The final results match the data found in literature. The
      interdoctor variability opens the way to optimise the recording of iatrogeny with
      drug-monotoring centres.

TI  - New threats to health data privacy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Along with the rapid digitalization of health data (e.g. Electronic
      Health Records), there is an increasing concern on maintaining data privacy while
      garnering the benefits, especially when the data are required to be published for
      secondary use. Most of the current research on protecting health data privacy is 
      centered around data de-identification and data anonymization, which removes the 
      identifiable information from the published health data to prevent an adversary
      from reasoning about the privacy of the patients. However, published health data 
      is not the only source that the adversaries can count on: with a large amount of 
      information that people voluntarily share on the Web, sophisticated attacks that 
      join disparate information pieces from multiple sources against health data
      privacy become practical. Limited efforts have been devoted to studying these
      attacks yet. RESULTS: We study how patient privacy could be compromised with the 
      help of today's information technologies. In particular, we show that private
      healthcare information could be collected by aggregating and associating
      disparate pieces of information from multiple online data sources including
      online social networks, public records and search engine results. We demonstrate 
      a real-world case study to show user identity and privacy are highly vulnerable
      to the attribution, inference and aggregation attacks. We also show that people
      are highly identifiable to adversaries even with inaccurate information pieces
      about the target, with real data analysis. CONCLUSION: We claim that too much
      information has been made available electronic and available online that people
      are very vulnerable without effective privacy protection.

TI  - New tools for an old trade: a socio-technical appraisal of how electronic
      decision support is used by primary care practitioners.
PG  - 1002-18
LID - 10.1111/j.1467-9566.2011.01361.x [doi]
AB  - This article explores Australian general practitioners' (GPs) views on a novel
      electronic decision support (EDS) tool being developed for cardiovascular disease
      management. We use Timmermans and Berg's technology-in-practice approach to
      examine how technologies influence and are influenced by the social networks in
      which they are placed. In all, 21 general practitioners who piloted the tool were
      interviewed. The tool occupied an ill-defined middle ground in a dialectical
      relationship between GPs' routine care and factors promoting best practice.
      Drawing on Lipsky's concept of 'street-level bureaucrats', the tool's ability to 
      process workloads expeditiously was of greatest appeal to GPs. This feature of
      the tool gave it the potential to alter the structure, process and content of
      healthcare encounters. The credibility of EDS tools appears to be mediated by
      fluid notions of best practice, based on an expert scrutiny of the evidence,
      synthesis via authoritative guidelines and dissemination through trusted and
      often informal networks. Balanced against this is the importance of 'soft' forms 
      of knowledge such as intuition and timing in everyday decision-making. This
      resonates with Aristotle's theory of phronesis (practical wisdom) and may render 
      EDS tools inconsequential if they merely process biomedical data. While EDS tools
      show promise in improving health practitioner performance, the socio-technical
      dimensions of their implementation warrant careful consideration.

TI  - The impact of the introduction of smoke-free legislation on prescribing of
      stop-smoking medications in England.
PG  - 1827-34
LID - 10.1111/j.1360-0443.2011.03494.x [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To investigate whether there were changes in the rate of prescribing of
      smoking cessation medications in the months leading up to, and after, the
      introduction of smoke-free legislation in England. DESIGN: Interrupted
      time-series analysis of prescribing rates using Autoregressive Integrated Moving 
      Average (ARIMA) models. SETTING: A total of 350 general practices in England who 
      contribute data to The Health Improvement Network (THIN) database. PARTICIPANTS: 
      Patients in THIN aged 16+ identified from their medical records as smokers.
      MEASUREMENTS: Monthly rates of prescribing of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT),
      bupropion and varenicline were calculated from THIN from 2000 to 2009 for all
      smokers and for subgroups defined by patient sex, age group, history of chronic
      disease and quintile of the Townsend Index of Deprivation. ARIMA models were
      built to assess whether there were changes in prescribing before or after the
      introduction of smoke-free legislation over and above any long-term and seasonal 
      trends. FINDINGS: There was a 6.4% (0.7-12.1) increase in prescribing of all
      smoking cessation medications in the 9 months before the introduction of
      smoke-free legislation and a 6.4% (1.1-11.7) reduction in the 9-month period
      afterwards. A 6.2% (1.4-11.0) increase in NRT prescribing and a 13.2% (4.3-22.2) 
      increase in bupropion prescribing occurred in the 6- and 3-month periods,
      respectively, before smoke-free legislation was introduced, and a 5.5% (2.3-8.7) 
      decline in NRT prescribing and a 13.7% (4.6-22.8) decline in bupropion
      prescribing in the 9 months post-legislation. The patterns of change in
      prescribing did not vary with patient demographics. CONCLUSIONS: Numbers of
      primary care prescriptions for smoking cessation medications increased prior to
      the introduction of smoke-free legislation but decreased afterwards, suggesting a
      temporal displacement in prescribing activity rather than a change in the overall
      volume of prescribing. Effects observed were consistent across all population
      subgroups, suggesting that the changes in prescribing will neither widen nor
      reduce smoking-related health inequalities.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess whether connections between physicians based on shared
      patients in administrative data correspond with professional relationships
      between physicians. DATA SOURCES/STUDY SETTING: Survey of physicians affiliated
      with a large academic and community physicians' organization and 2006 Medicare
      data from a 100 percent sample of patients in the Boston Hospital referral
      region. STUDY DESIGN/DATA COLLECTION: We administered a web-based survey to 616
      physicians (response rate: 63 percent) about referral and advice relationships
      with physician colleagues. Relationships measured by this questionnaire were
      compared with relationships assessed by patient sharing, measured using 2006
      Medicare data. Each physician was presented with an individualized roster of
      physicians' names with whom they did and did not share patients based on the
      Medicare data. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The probability of two physicians having a
      recognized professional relationship increased with the number of Medicare
      patients shared, with up to 82 percent of relationships recognized with nine
      shared patients, overall representing a diagnostic test with an area under the
      receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.73 (95 percent CI: 0.70-0.75).
      Primary care physicians were more likely to recognize relationships than medical 
      or surgical specialists (p<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Patient sharing identified using
      administrative data is an informative "diagnostic test" for predicting the
      existence of relationships between physicians. This finding validates a method
      that can be used for future research to map networks of physicians.

TI  - Limiting the spread of highly resistant hospital-acquired microorganisms via
      critical care transfers: a simulation study.
PG  - 1633-40
LID - 10.1007/s00134-011-2341-y [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Hospital-acquired infections with highly resistant organisms are an
      important problem among critically ill patients. Control of these organisms has
      largely focused within individual hospitals. We examine the extent to which
      transfers of critically ill patients could be a vector for the wide spread of
      highly resistant organisms, and compare the efficiency of different approaches to
      targeting infection control resources. METHODS: We analyzed the network of
      interhospital transfers of intensive care unit patients in 2005 US Medicare data 
      and 2004-2006 Pennsylvania all-payer data. We simulated the spread of highly
      resistant hospital-acquired infections by randomly choosing a single hospital to 
      develop a highly resistant organism and following the spread of infection or
      colonization throughout the network under varying strategies of infection control
      and varying levels of infectivity. RESULTS: Critical care transfers could spread 
      a highly resistant organism between any two US hospitals in a median of 3 years. 
      Hospitals varied substantially in their importance to limiting potential spread. 
      Targeting resources to a small subset of hospitals on the basis of their position
      in the transfer network was 16 times more efficient than distributing infection
      control resources uniformly. Within any set of targeted hospitals, the best
      strategy for infection control heavily concentrated resources at a few
      particularly important hospitals, regardless of level of infectivity.
      CONCLUSIONS: Critical care transfers provide a plausible vector for widespread
      dissemination of highly resistant hospital-acquired microorganisms. Infection
      control efforts can be made more efficient by selectively targeting hospitals
      most important for transmission.

TI  - Influence of pharmacy practice on community pharmacists' integration of
      medication and lab value information from electronic health records.
PG  - 591-8
LID - 10.1331/JAPhA.2011.10085 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe how an electronic health record (EHR) was integrated into
      community pharmacists' patterns of patient care and to explore factors that are
      related to the use of medication and laboratory value information from the EHR.
      DESIGN: Descriptive, exploratory, nonexperimental study. SETTING: Edmonton,
      Canada, between November 2008 and March 2009. PARTICIPANTS: 16 pharmacists, 3
      pharmacy technicians, and 2 pharmacy interns from primary care networks,
      long-term care settings, community independent and chain pharmacies, and grocery 
      store pharmacies. INTERVENTION: Qualitative interviews. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE:
      Pharmacists' self-reported use of EHR. RESULTS: Pharmacists in a patient-centered
      care practice (involving medication therapy management activities) were more
      likely to adopt the EHR for medication history and laboratory values, whereas
      pharmacists whose practice was focused on medication dispensing primarily used
      the EHR for patient demographic and dispensing records. Six general factors
      influenced the use of EHR: patients, pharmacists, pharmacy, other health
      professionals (i.e., physicians), EHR, and environment. Access to the medical
      record versus EHR and timeliness were barriers specific to pharmacists in a
      patient-centered practice. Factors that affected EHR use for pharmacists with
      primarily a dispensing practice were role understanding, dispensing versus lab
      records, valid reasons for using EHR, and fear of legal and disciplinary issues. 
      CONCLUSION: Many community pharmacists embraced the EHR as a part of practice
      change, particularly those in patient-centered care practices. Practice type
      (patient-centered care or dispensing) greatly influenced pharmacists' use of EHR,
      specifically laboratory values. Because these qualitative findings are
      exploratory in nature, they may not be generalized beyond the participating
      pharmacies.

TI  - Temporal and within practice variability in the health improvement network.
PG  - 948-55

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Health Improvement Network (THIN) database is a primary care
      electronic medical record database in the UK designed for pharmacoepidemiologic
      research. Matching on practice and calendar year often is used to account for
      secular trends in time and differences across practices. However, little is known
      about the consistency within practices across observation years and among
      practices within a given year, in THIN or other large medical record databases.
      METHODS: We analyzed mortality rates, cancer incidence rates, prescribing rates, 
      and encounter rates across 415 practices from 2000 to 2007 using a practice-year 
      as the unit of observation in separate random and fixed effects longitudinal
      Poisson regression models. Adjusted models accounted for aggregate practice-level
      characteristics (smoking, obesity, age, and Vision software experience). RESULTS:
      In adjusted models, subsequent calendar years were associated with lower reported
      mortality rates, increasing cancer reporting rates, increasing prescriptions per 
      patient, and decreasing encounters per patient, with a corresponding linear trend
      (p < 0.001 for all analyses). For calendar year 2007, the ratio of the 75th
      percentile to the 25th percentile for crude rate of cancer, mortality,
      prescriptions, and encounters was 1.63, 1.63, 1.45, and 1.42, respectively.
      Adjusting for practice characteristics reduced the among-practice variation by
      approximately 40%. CONCLUSIONS: THIN data are characterized by secular trends and
      among-practice variation, both of which should be considered in the design of
      pharmacoepidemiology studies. Whether these are trends in data quality or true
      secular trends could not be definitively differentiated.

TI  - Use of Medicaid data to explore community characteristics associated with HIV
      prevalence among beneficiaries with schizophrenia.
PG  - 89-101
AB  - OBJECTIVES: People with severe mental illness (SMI) may be at increased risk for 
      several adverse health conditions, including HIV/AIDS. This disproportionate
      disease burden has been studied primarily at the individual rather than community
      level, in part due to the rarity of data sources linking individual information
      on medical and mental health characteristics with community-level data. We
      demonstrated the potential of Medicaid data to address this gap. METHODS: We
      analyzed data on Medicaid beneficiaries with schizophrenia from eight states that
      account for 66% of cumulative AIDS cases nationally. RESULTS: Across 44
      metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs), the treated prevalence of HIV among adult 
      Medicaid beneficiaries diagnosed with schizophrenia was 1.56% (standard deviation
      = 1.31%). To explore possible causes of variation, we linked claims files with a 
      range of MSA social and contextual variables including local AIDS prevalence
      rates, area-based economic measures, crime rates, substance abuse treatment
      resources, and estimates of injection drug users (IDUs) and HIV infection among
      IDUs, which strongly predicted community infection rates among people with
      schizophrenia. CONCLUSIONS: Effective strategies for HIV prevention among people 
      with SMI may include targeting prevention efforts to areas where risk is
      greatest; examining social network links between IDU and SMI groups; and
      implementing harm reduction, drug treatment, and other interventions to reduce
      HIV spread among IDUs. Our findings also suggest the need for research on HIV
      among people with SMI that examines geographical variation and demonstrates the
      potential use of health-care claims data to provide epidemiologic insights into
      small-area variations and trends in physical health among those with SMI.

TI  - Prescribing of nicotine replacement therapy to adolescents in England.
PG  - 1513-9
LID - 10.1111/j.1360-0443.2011.03449.x [doi]
AB  - AIMS: In November 2005, the indications for nicotine replacement therapy (NRT)
      were broadened in the United Kingdom, making all forms available to
      12-17-year-olds. This study aimed to estimate the effects of this change on
      prescribing of NRT to adolescents in England. DESIGN: Segmented regression
      analysis of primary care data on prescribing of nicotine replacement therapy
      using general additive mixed models. SETTING: A total of 350 general practices in
      England included in The Health Improvement Network (THIN), a database of UK
      electronic primary care records. PARTICIPANTS: All 12-17-year-old patients
      registered with a THIN practice in England. Measurements Monthly rates of
      prescribing of NRT per 100 000 12-17-year-old patients registered with a THIN
      practice between January 2002 and June 2009. FINDINGS: Prescribing of NRT was
      highest in 16-17-year-olds and extremely low in 12-13-year-olds, generally fewer 
      than 10 prescriptions per 100 000 adolescents per month. Girls tended to be
      prescribed NRT more frequently than boys. In 12-17-year-olds rates of prescribing
      were increasing prior to the broadening of indications, and there was no step
      change, but the rate of increase was lower, after the indications were broadened.
      CONCLUSIONS: Recent changes to the marketing licence for nicotine replacement
      therapy in England to include adolescents appear to have had little or no effect 
      on prescribing practices.

TI  - Advantages of the dental practice-based research network initiative and its role 
      in dental education.
PG  - 1053-60
AB  - Practice-based research networks (PBRNs) provide a novel venue in which providers
      can increase their knowledge base and improve delivery of care through
      participation in clinical studies. This article describes some aspects of our
      experience with a National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial
      Research-supported PBRN and discusses the role it can play in dental education.
      PBRNs create a structured pathway for providers to advance their professional
      development by participating in the process of collecting data through clinical
      research. This process allows practitioners to contribute to the goals of
      evidence-based dentistry by helping to provide a foundation of evidence on which 
      to base clinical decisions as opposed to relying on anecdotal evidence. PBRNs
      strengthen the professional knowledge base by applying the principles of good
      clinical practice, creating a resource for future dental faculty, training
      practitioners on best practices, and increasing the responsibility,
      accountability, and scope of care. PBRNs can be the future pivotal instruments of
      change in dental education, the use of electronic health record systems,
      diagnostic codes, and the role of comparative effectiveness research, which can
      create an unprecedented opportunity for the dental profession to advance and be
      integrated into the health care system.

PG  - 804-6
LID - 10.1097/ACM.0b013e31821d8409 [doi]
AB  - The physician signout note is a widely used clinical document that supports
      patient safety and care continuity during patient handoff in the hospital.
      Despite its centrality to patient care, the signout note is not considered an
      official document, and it is, therefore, not generally standardized or taught to 
      medical trainees, nor is it usually integrated into electronic health records
      (EHRs). This commentary outlines several of the potential advantages to
      establishing the physician signout note as an official part of the medical
      record, such as the facilitation of information flow between signout notes and
      other parts of the patient chart and the possibility of integrating decision
      support tools into this important aspect of the clinical workflow. The authors
      address frequently encountered concerns regarding the establishment of the
      signout note as an official part of the medical record. They conclude by making
      recommendations for integrating signout notes into EHRs and using modern, social 
      Web technologies in such an implementation.

AB  - AIMS: To estimate the effect of the introduction of a new smoking cessation
      medication, varenicline, and the publication of guidance related to its use, on
      trends in prescribing of smoking cessation medications in England. DESIGN:
      Interrupted time series analysis of primary care data on prescribing of smoking
      cessation medication using autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA)
      modelling. SETTING: A total of 446 general practices included in The Health
      Improvement Network (THIN), a database of UK electronic primary care records.
      PARTICIPANTS: All primary care patients registered with a THIN practice in
      England. MEASUREMENTS: Monthly rates of prescribing of varenicline, nicotine
      replacement therapy (NRT) and bupropion per 100 000 patients registered with a
      THIN practice between June 2000 and June 2009. FINDINGS: NRT was the most
      commonly prescribed stop smoking medication, and bupropion the least frequently
      prescribed. After its introduction in December 2006 varenicline rapidly became
      the second most commonly prescribed drug. There was no statistically significant 
      change in overall prescribing for smoking cessation medications after its
      introduction (P = 0.760), or after the publication of the related guidance in
      July 2007 (P = 0.134). CONCLUSIONS: Soon after being introduced in England,
      varenicline was widely prescribed; after nicotine replacement therapy it was the 
      most commonly prescribed cessation medication. However, this does not appear to
      have increased overall rates of prescribing for smoking cessation medication.

TI  - Bariatric surgery using a network and teleconferencing to serve remote patients
      in the Veterans Administration Health Care System: feasibility and results.
PG  - 71-6
LID - 10.1016/j.amjsurg.2010.06.016 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previously, Midwestern veteran patients had limited bariatric surgery
      access because they lived long distances from a bariatric surgery center (BSC).
      The creation and outcomes of a network to increase bariatric surgery access and
      patient satisfaction with teleconsultation are discussed. METHODS: Several
      referring Midwestern Veterans Affairs Medical Centers (VAMCs) performed pre- and 
      postoperative management and were linked by teleconferencing and a computerized
      patient record system to a single BSC. RESULTS: Twenty-eight high-risk patients
      (older, male) residing an average distance of 324.5 miles from the BSC underwent 
      gastric bypass. Eighty-two percent used teleconferencing for the initial surgical
      consultation with excellent patient satisfaction saving at least 19,000 miles and
      69 travel days. Surgical outcomes were equivalent and follow-up was excellent
      (96.6%) compared with non-Veterans Affairs patients. CONCLUSIONS: A cooperative
      network using teleconference and computerized records facilitated bariatric
      surgery in high-risk, remotely located VA patients with high patient satisfaction
      and without compromising surgical outcomes.

TI  - Electronic health records vs Medicaid claims: completeness of diabetes preventive
      care data in community health centers.
PG  - 351-8
LID - 10.1370/afm.1279 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Electronic Health Record (EHR) databases in community health centers
      (CHCs) present new opportunities for quality improvement, comparative
      effectiveness, and health policy research. We aimed (1) to create
      individual-level linkages between EHR data from a network of CHCs and Medicaid
      claims from 2005 through 2007; (2) to examine congruence between these data
      sources; and (3) to identify sociodemographic characteristics associated with
      documentation of services in one data set vs the other. METHODS: We studied
      receipt of preventive services among established diabetic patients in 50 Oregon
      CHCs who had ever been enrolled in Medicaid (N = 2,103). We determined which
      services were documented in EHR data vs in Medicaid claims data, and we described
      the sociodemographic characteristics associated with these documentation
      patterns. RESULTS: In 2007, the following services were documented in Medicaid
      claims but not the EHR: 11.6% of total cholesterol screenings received, 7.0% of
      total influenza vaccinations, 10.5% of nephropathy screenings, and 8.8% of tests 
      for glycated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)). In contrast, the following services were
      documented in the EHR but not in Medicaid claims: 49.3% of cholesterol
      screenings, 50.4% of influenza vaccinations, 50.1% of nephropathy screenings, and
      48.4% of HbA(1c) tests. Patients who were older, male, Spanish-speaking, above
      the federal poverty level, or who had discontinuous insurance were more likely to
      have services documented in the EHR but not in the Medicaid claims data.
      CONCLUSIONS: Networked EHRs provide new opportunities for obtaining more
      comprehensive data regarding health services received, especially among
      populations who are discontinuously insured. Relying solely on Medicaid claims
      data is likely to substantially underestimate the quality of care.

TI  - A feasibility study for the provision of electronic healthcare tools and services
      in areas of Greece, Cyprus and Italy.
PG  - 49
LID - 10.1186/1475-925X-10-49 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Through this paper, we present the initial steps for the creation of 
      an integrated platform for the provision of a series of eHealth tools and
      services to both citizens and travelers in isolated areas of the southeast
      Mediterranean, and on board ships travelling across it. The platform was created 
      through an INTERREG IIIB ARCHIMED project called INTERMED. METHODS: The support
      of primary healthcare, home care and the continuous education of physicians are
      the three major issues that the proposed platform is trying to facilitate. The
      proposed system is based on state-of-the-art telemedicine systems and is able to 
      provide the following healthcare services: i) Telecollaboration and
      teleconsultation services between remotely located healthcare providers, ii)
      telemedicine services in emergencies, iii) home telecare services for "at risk"
      citizens such as the elderly and patients with chronic diseases, and iv)
      eLearning services for the continuous training through seminars of both
      healthcare personnel (physicians, nurses etc) and persons supporting "at risk"
      citizens.These systems support data transmission over simple phone lines,
      internet connections, integrated services digital network/digital subscriber
      lines, satellite links, mobile networks (GPRS/3G), and wireless local area
      networks. The data corresponds, among others, to voice, vital biosignals, still
      medical images, video, and data used by eLearning applications. The proposed
      platform comprises several systems, each supporting different services. These
      were integrated using a common data storage and exchange scheme in order to
      achieve system interoperability in terms of software, language and national
      characteristics. RESULTS: The platform has been installed and evaluated in
      different rural and urban sites in Greece, Cyprus and Italy. The evaluation was
      mainly related to technical issues and user satisfaction. The selected sites are,
      among others, rural health centers, ambulances, homes of "at-risk" citizens, and 
      a ferry. CONCLUSIONS: The results proved the functionality and utilization of the
      platform in various rural places in Greece, Cyprus and Italy. However, further
      actions are needed to enable the local healthcare systems and the different
      population groups to be familiarized with, and use in their everyday lives,
      mature technological solutions for the provision of healthcare services.

TI  - Improving antibiotic use in the hospital: Focusing on positive blood cultures is 
      an effective option.
PG  - e297-303
LID - 10.1016/j.lpm.2010.12.014 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The unsolicited and systematic evaluation of positive blood cultures 
      (pBC) after laboratory report by a single infectious disease specialist (IDS) was
      evaluated during one year, using a computer-generated alert by the laboratory.
      The main objectives of IDS counselling were to improve antibiotic use for
      bloodstream infection (i.e., initiating or modifying therapy) and to stop
      unjustified therapy for contaminated pBC. METHODS: During the first part of the
      study (4 months), all pBC in patients from ICUs, medical and surgical wards were 
      analyzed. After an interim analysis, only pBC from medical and surgical wards
      were evaluated during the second part (8 months). RESULTS: Overall, 1090 episodes
      of pBC (representing 866 patients) were evaluated and classified as bloodstream
      infection (65.5%), contamination (29%) or undetermined (5.5%). Forty-three
      percent of episodes prompted IDS counselling, including initiation (5%),
      modification (27.5%), withdrawal (3.5%) and diagnosis workup (5%). Restricting
      the evaluation to medical and surgical wards increased the rate of counselling
      (61.2% vs. 27.7%, P<0.0001), notably for de-escalating (20% vs. 8%, P<0.0001),
      initiating (9% vs. 2%, P<0.0001), oral switch (6% vs. 2%, P<0.0001), withdrawing 
      (5% vs. 2%, P=0.002) or reducing the duration of therapy (5% vs. 2%, P=0.002).
      DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: In complement to the laboratory report, a
      computer-generated alert used by the IDS was useful for the management of pBC in 
      hospital. The impact of IDS counselling was more effective when the evaluation
      was restricted to medical and surgical wards.

TI  - Gaining insight into benzodiazepine prescribing in General Practice in France: a 
      data-based study.
PG  - 28
LID - 10.1186/1471-2296-12-28 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In recent decades, benzodiazepine (BZD) prescriptions have been
      called into question in most European countries by physicians and health
      authorities alike, and guidelines on medical indications and treatment duration
      have been established to avoid long-term use and dependency. In France, many
      public policy measures have been implemented as BZDs are among the most
      prescribed medications. General practitioners (GPs) were identified by the Caisse
      d'Assurance Maladie (the French public health insurance fund) as high prescribers
      for these drugs. In this context, the aim of the study was to determine GPs'
      rates and to identify correlates of BZD and Z-drugs prescribing. METHODS: Data on
      patient characteristics, diagnoses and BZD prescriptions were drawn from French
      GPs' electronic medical records. These were accessed via the database which the
      Societe Francaise de Medecine Generale, the French Society of General Practice,
      has been compiling since 1993 in a network of 90 GPs working mainly in solo
      practices. The participants in this network routinely register data in their
      daily practice. The present study examined 51,216 patients from 52 GP practices
      and we performed a multivariate logistic regression. The dependent variable was
      whether a patient was prescribed BZD at least once during 2006. RESULTS: In the
      present study, 12.5% of patients older than 18 were prescribed BZDs at least once
      during 2006 and the average (SD) was 2.6 (2.4) BZD prescriptions/patient/year.
      The adjusted odds (confidence interval) of having at least one BZD prescription
      were 1.20 (1.10 - 1.30) in patients older than 65; 1.05 (1.01 - 1.10) in women;
      1.25 (1.17 - 1.33) in patients with associated comorbidities (cardiovascular
      diseases) and 1.76 (1.62 - 1.92) in heavy consumers of health care (more than 4
      consultations with a GP per year). CONCLUSIONS: The present study showed the
      persistence of high rates of BZD prescription by GPs, particularly in women and
      older patients, which highlights the difficulties of implementing effective
      public policies and the necessity of using new approaches enabling doctors and
      patients to understand the true relative advantages, disadvantages, and
      consequences of using these drugs and of non-pharmaceutical treatments.

      RETE IMA WEB survey].
PG  - 354-64
LID - 10.1714/643.7501 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The organization of a regional system of care (RSC) for ST-elevation 
      myocardial infarction (STEMI) is recommended by the Italian Federation of
      Cardiology (FIC) and international guidelines in order to increase the number of 
      patients treated with primary coronary angioplasty and, more in general, with
      reperfusion therapy, speed up the diagnostic and therapeutic processes, and
      ultimately improve the outcome. METHODS: The "RETE IMA WEB" survey was launched
      in 2007 from the Italian Society of Invasive Cardiology (SICI-GISE) in
      collaboration with the FIC, with the aim of evaluating the current state of RSC
      for STEMI in Italy. The personnel of the 118 Emergency System participated in the
      survey. Data collection was made using different electronic forms with access
      limited by personal passwords. We assessed the organization of the RSC together
      with local resource availability, with specific attention to the distance from a 
      Hub center. RESULTS: The survey ended in December 31, 2008. We censored 701
      hospitals admitting STEMI patients, 157 (22.4%) with uninterrupted access (h24/7 
      days) to the catheterization laboratory (2.67 per million inhabitants). An
      operative network was present in 36/103 (35.9%) provinces, with important
      geographic variability. Among hospitals without a full-time primary angioplasty
      facility, only 46% was within a RSC. ECG was available in 72% of the national
      territory, telemedicine in 50%. Prehospital fibrinolysis was available in 16% of 
      the country. Overall, 92.4% of the Italian population resides within 60 min of a 
      Hub center. CONCLUSIONS: In 2008, despite an adequate framework, the RSC for
      STEMI in Italy was heterogeneous and still suboptimal. Healthcare administrators,
      scientific societies and all operators involved in the process of care for STEMI 
      should make efforts to implement current guidelines.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: A full-text search engine can be a useful tool for augmenting the
      reuse value of unstructured narrative data stored in electronic health records
      (EHR). A prominent barrier to the effective utilization of such tools originates 
      from users' lack of search expertise and/or medical-domain knowledge. To mitigate
      the issue, the authors experimented with a 'collaborative search' feature through
      a homegrown EHR search engine that allows users to preserve their search
      knowledge and share it with others. This feature was inspired by the success of
      many social information-foraging techniques used on the web that leverage users' 
      collective wisdom to improve the quality and efficiency of information retrieval.
      DESIGN: The authors conducted an empirical evaluation study over a 4-year period.
      The user sample consisted of 451 academic researchers, medical practitioners, and
      hospital administrators. The data were analyzed using a social-network analysis
      to delineate the structure of the user collaboration networks that mediated the
      diffusion of knowledge of search. RESULTS: The users embraced the concept with
      considerable enthusiasm. About half of the EHR searches processed by the system
      (0.44 million) were based on stored search knowledge; 0.16 million utilized
      shared knowledge made available by other users. The social-network analysis
      results also suggest that the user-collaboration networks engendered by the
      collaborative search feature played an instrumental role in enabling the transfer
      of search knowledge across people and domains. CONCLUSION: Applying collaborative
      search, a social information-foraging technique popularly used on the web, may
      provide the potential to improve the quality and efficiency of information
      retrieval in healthcare.

TI  - Learning relational policies from electronic health record access logs.
PG  - 333-42
LID - 10.1016/j.jbi.2011.01.007 [doi]
AB  - Modern healthcare organizations (HCOs) are composed of complex dynamic teams to
      ensure clinical operations are executed in a quick and competent manner. At the
      same time, the fluid nature of such environments hinders administrators' efforts 
      to define access control policies that appropriately balance patient privacy and 
      healthcare functions. Manual efforts to define these policies are labor-intensive
      and error-prone, often resulting in systems that endow certain care providers
      with overly broad access to patients' medical records while restricting other
      providers from legitimate and timely use. In this work, we propose an alternative
      method to generate these policies by automatically mining usage patterns from
      electronic health record (EHR) systems. EHR systems are increasingly being
      integrated into clinical environments and our approach is designed to be
      generalizable across HCOs, thus assisting in the design and evaluation of local
      access control policies. Our technique, which is grounded in data mining and
      social network analysis theory, extracts a statistical model of the organization 
      from the access logs of its EHRs. In doing so, our approach enables the review of
      predefined policies, as well as the discovery of unknown behaviors. We evaluate
      our approach with 5 months of access logs from the Vanderbilt University Medical 
      Center and confirm the existence of stable social structures and intuitive
      business operations. Additionally, we demonstrate that there is significant
      turnover in the interactions between users in the HCO and that policies learned
      at the department-level afford greater stability over time.

      research.
PG  - 196-202

AB  - New clinical studies in medicine are based on patients and controls using
      different imaging diagnostic modalities. Medical information systems are not
      designed for clinical trials employing clinical imaging. Although commercial
      software and communication systems focus on storage of image data, they are not
      suitable for storage and mining of new types of quantitative data. We sought to
      design a Web-tool to support diagnostic clinical trials involving different
      experts and hospitals or research centres. The image analysis of this project is 
      based on skeletal X-ray imaging. It involves a computerised image method using
      quantitative analysis of regions of interest in healthy bone and skeletal
      metastases. The database is implemented with ASP.NET 3.5 and C# technologies for 
      our Web-based application. For data storage, we chose MySQL v.5.0, one of the
      most popular open source databases. User logins were necessary, and access to
      patient data was logged for auditing. For security, all data transmissions were
      carried over encrypted connections. This Web-tool is available to users scattered
      at different locations; it allows an efficient organisation and storage of data
      (case report form) and images and allows each user to know precisely what his
      task is. The advantages of our Web-tool are as follows: (1) sustainability is
      guaranteed; (2) network locations for collection of data are secured; (3) all
      clinical information is stored together with the original images and the results 
      derived from processed images and statistical analysis that enable us to perform 
      retrospective studies; (4) changes are easily incorporated because of the modular
      architecture; and (5) assessment of trial data collected at different sites is
      centralised to reduce statistical variance.

      electronic health record adoption.
PG  - 151-61
LID - 10.1007/s10916-009-9352-z [doi]
AB  - Return on investment (ROI) concerns related to Electronic Health Records (EHRs)
      are a major barrier to the technology's adoption. Physicians generally rely upon 
      early adopters to vet new technologies prior to putting them into widespread use.
      Therefore, early adopters' experiences with EHRs play a major role in determining
      future adoption patterns. The paper's purposes are: (1) to map the EHR value
      streams that define the ROI calculation; and (2) to compare Current Users' and
      Intended Adopters' perceived value streams to identify similarities, differences 
      and governing constructs. Primary data was collected by the Texas Medical
      Association, which surveyed 1,772 physicians on their use and perceptions of
      practice gains from EHR adoption. Using Bayesian Belief Network Modeling, value
      streams are constructed for both current EHR users and Intended Adopters. Current
      Users and Intended Adopters differ significantly in their perceptions of the EHR 
      value stream. Intended Adopters' value stream displays complex relationships
      among the potential gains compared to the simpler, linear relationship that
      Current Users identified. The Current Users identify "Reduced Medical Records
      Costs" as the gain that governs the value stream while Intended Adopters believe 
      "Reduced Charge Capture Costs" define the value stream's starting point. Current 
      Users' versus Intended Adopters' assessments of EHR benefits differ significantly
      and qualitatively from one another.

TI  - An open, interoperable, and scalable prehospital information technology network
      architecture.
PG  - 149-57
LID - 10.3109/10903127.2010.534235 [doi]
AB  - Some of the most intractable challenges in prehospital medicine include response 
      time optimization, inefficiencies at the emergency medical services
      (EMS)-emergency department (ED) interface, and the ability to correlate field
      interventions with patient outcomes. Information technology (IT) can address
      these and other concerns by ensuring that system and patient information is
      received when and where it is needed, is fully integrated with prior and
      subsequent patient information, and is securely archived. Some EMS agencies have 
      begun adopting information technologies, such as wireless transmission of 12-lead
      electrocardiograms, but few agencies have developed a comprehensive plan for
      management of their prehospital information and integration with other electronic
      medical records. This perspective article highlights the challenges and
      limitations of integrating IT elements without a strategic plan, and proposes an 
      open, interoperable, and scalable prehospital information technology (PHIT)
      architecture. The two core components of this PHIT architecture are 1) routers
      with broadband network connectivity to share data between ambulance devices and
      EMS system information services and 2) an electronic patient care report to
      organize and archive all electronic prehospital data. To successfully implement
      this comprehensive PHIT architecture, data and technology requirements must be
      based on best available evidence, and the system must adhere to health data
      standards as well as privacy and security regulations. Recent federal legislation
      prioritizing health information technology may position federal agencies to help 
      design and fund PHIT architectures.

LID - 10.1136/jamia.2010.008441 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To measure the time spent authoring and viewing documentation and to
      study patterns of usage in healthcare practice. DESIGN: Audit logs for an
      electronic health record were used to calculate rates, and social network
      analysis was applied to ascertain usage patterns. Subjects comprised all care
      providers at an urban academic medical center who authored or viewed electronic
      documentation. MEASUREMENT: Rate and time of authoring and viewing clinical
      documentation, and associations among users were measured. RESULTS: Users spent
      20-103 min per day authoring notes and 7-56 min per day viewing notes, with
      physicians spending less than 90 min per day total. About 16% of attendings'
      notes, 8% of residents' notes, and 38% of nurses' notes went unread by other
      users, and, overall, 16% of notes were never read by anyone. Viewing of notes
      dropped quickly with the age of the note, but notes were read at a low but
      measurable rate, even after 2 years. Most healthcare teams (77%) included a
      nurse, an attending, and a resident, and those three users' groups were the first
      to write notes during an admission. Limitations The limitations were restriction 
      to a single academic medical center and use of log files without direct
      observation. CONCLUSIONS: Care providers spend a significant amount of time
      viewing and authoring notes. Many notes are never read, and rates of usage vary
      significantly by author and viewer. While the rate of viewing a note drops
      quickly with its age, even after 2 years inpatient notes are still viewed.

TI  - Explaining physicians' use of EMR systems and performance in the shakedown phase.
PG  - 125-30
LID - 10.1136/jamia.2010.009316 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This work seeks to complement and extend prior work by using a
      multidisciplinary approach to explain electronic medical records (EMR) system use
      and consequent performance (here, patient satisfaction) among physicians during
      early stages of the implementation of an EMR. DESIGN: This was a quantitative
      study, with data obtained from three distinct sources: individual-level and
      social-network data from employees; use data from EMR system logs; and patient
      satisfaction data from patients and/or authorized decision-makers. Responses were
      obtained from 151 physicians and 8440 patient satisfaction surveys over the
      course of a 1-year period at the shakedown phase of an EMR system implementation.
      RESULTS: Physicians who were better connected, both directly and indirectly, to
      their peers-that is, other physicians-for advice on their work, used the system
      less than those who were less connected. In addition to such social network ties,
      demographic characteristics (gender and age), three personality characteristics
      (openness to experience, agreeableness and extroversion) and a key technology
      perception (perceived usefulness) predicted EMR system use. CONCLUSIONS: For
      hospital administrators and other stakeholders, understanding the contributors
      to, and the relative importance of, various factors in explaining EMR system use,
      and its impact on patient satisfaction is of great importance. The factors
      identified in this work that influence a physician's use of EMR systems can be
      used to develop interventions and applications that can increase physician buy-in
      and use of EMR systems.

TI  - The patient and the computer in the primary care consultation.
PG  - 138-42
LID - 10.1136/jamia.2010.006486 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Studies of the doctor-patient relationship have focused on the
      elaboration of power and/or authority using a range of techniques to study the
      encounter between doctor and patient. The widespread adoption of computers by
      doctors brings a third party into the consultation. While there has been some
      research into the way doctors view and manage this new relationship, the behavior
      of patients in response to the computer is rarely studied. In this paper, the
      authors use Goffman's dramaturgy to explore patients' approaches to the doctor's 
      computer in the consultation, and its influence on the patient-doctor
      relationship. DESIGN: Observational study of Australian general practice. 141
      consultations from 20 general practitioners were videotaped and analyzed using a 
      hermeneutic framework. RESULTS: Patients negotiated the relationship between
      themselves, the doctor, and the computer demonstrating two themes: dyadic
      (dealing primarily with the doctor) or triadic (dealing with both computer and
      doctor). Patients used three signaling behaviors in relation to the computer on
      the doctor's desk (screen watching, screen ignoring, and screen excluding) to
      influence the behavior of the doctor. Patients were able to draw the doctor to
      the computer, and used the computer to challenge doctor's statements. CONCLUSION:
      This study demonstrates that in consultations where doctors use computers, the
      computer can legitimately be regarded as part of a triadic relationship. Routine 
      use of computers in the consultation changes the doctor-patient relationship, and
      is altering the distribution of power and authority between doctor and patient.

TI  - Sharing is caring, but not error free: transparency of granular controls for
      sharing personal health information in social networks.
PG  - 559-68
AB  - When patients share personal health information with family and friends, their
      social networks become better equipped to help them through serious health
      situations. Thus, patients need tools that enable granular control over what
      personal health information is shared and with whom within social networks. Yet, 
      we know little about how well such tools support patients' complex sharing needs.
      We report on a lab study in which we examined the transparency of sharing
      interfaces that display an overview and details of information sharing with
      network connections in an internet-based personal health information management
      tool called HealthWeaver. Although participants found the interfaces easy to use 
      and were highly confident in their interpretation of the sharing controls,
      several participants made errors in determining what information was shared with 
      whom. Our findings point to the critical importance of future work that examines 
      design of usable interfaces that offer transparent granularity in support of
      patients' complex information sharing practices.

PG  - 491-500
AB  - We have developed a novel approach, the Digital Crumb Investigator, for using
      data collected as a byproduct of Electonic Health Record (EHR) use to help define
      care teams and care processes. We are developing tools and methods to utilize
      these routinely collected data to visualize and quantify care networks across
      acute care and ambulatory settings We have chosen a clinical care domain where
      clinicians use EHRs in their offices, on the maternity wards and in the neonatal 
      intensive care units as a test paradigm for this technology. The tools and
      methods we deliver should readily translate to other health care settings that
      collect behind-the-scenes electronic metadata such as audit trails. We believe
      that by applying the methods of social networking to define clinical
      relationships around a patient's care we will enable new areas of research into
      the usage of EHRs to promote patient safety and other improvements in care.

PG  - 152-60
AB  - Although comparative effectiveness trials and nationally recognized clinical
      guidelines offer substantial guidance about ideal patient treatment, we remain
      largely uninformed about the patterns of care seen in everyday clinical practice.
      To address this gap in knowledge, we looked at registry-based data on breast
      cancer care at two neighboring healthcare institutions with a specific focus on
      whether organizational boundaries determine the physicians that a patient will
      see. From an initial patient-oriented data set, we developed a social network of 
      physicians, modeling their interactions over the course of the provided
      treatments. Applying a mixture of visual and quantitative analyses to this
      network, we found evidence for strong intra-institutional ties and poignantly
      weak connections to physicians operating out of other healthcare centers.

TI  - Impact of EHR-based clinical decision support on adherence to guidelines for
      patients on NSAIDs: a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 22-30
LID - 10.1370/afm.1172 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Electronic health records (EHRs) with clinical decision support hold
      promise for improving quality of care, but their impact on management of chronic 
      conditions has been mixed. This study examined the impact of EHR-based clinical
      decision support on adherence to guidelines for reducing gastrointestinal
      complications in primary care patients on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
      (NSAIDs). METHODS: This randomized controlled trial was conducted in a national
      network of primary care offices using an EHR and focused on patients taking
      traditional NSAIDs who had factors associated with a high risk for
      gastrointestinal complications (a history of peptic ulcer disease; concomitant
      use of anticoagulants, anti-platelet medications [including aspirin], or
      corticosteroids; or an age of 75 years or older). The offices were randomized to 
      receive EHR-based guidelines and alerts for high-risk patients on NSAIDs, or
      usual care. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who received
      guideline-concordant care during the 1-year study period (June 2007-June 2008),
      defined as having their traditional NSAID discontinued (including a switch to a
      lower-risk medication), having a gastroprotective medication coprescribed, or
      both. RESULTS: Participants included 27 offices with 119 clinicians and 5,234
      high-risk patients. Intervention patients were more likely than usual care
      patients to receive guideline-concordant care (25.4% vs 22.4%, adjusted odds
      ratio = 1.19; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.42). For individual high-risk
      groups, patients on low-dose aspirin were more likely to receive
      guideline-concordant care with the intervention vs usual care (25.0% vs 20.8%,
      adjusted odds ratio = 1.30; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.62), but there was no
      significant difference for patients in other high-risk groups. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      study showed only a small impact of EHR-based clinical decision support for
      high-risk patients on NSAIDs in primary care offices. These results add to the
      growing literature about the complexity of EHR-based clinical decision support
      for improving quality of care.

TI  - Opening up the 'black box' of the electronic patient record: a linguistic
      ethnographic study in general practice.
PG  - 3-15
AB  - One of the most pervasive changes in general practice is the introduction of the 
      electronic patient record (EPR). The EPR supports both immediate clinical and
      anticipatory care (e.g. management of risk factors). Incorporating the EPR into
      social interaction is a complex task which is achieved discursively, clinician
      and patient responding to interactional contingencies as the consultation
      unfolds. Clinicians are presented with a 'dilemma of attention' as they seek to
      deal with the immediacy ('here and now') of the interpersonal interaction and the
      institutional demands ('there and then') of the EPR. We present data analysis
      which illuminates the EPR as an important presence in the clinic consultation
      context, one which places material and textual demands. Developing previous work 
      on the triadic (three party) consultation, our novel multimodal analysis of the
      EPR-in-use suggests there is value in considering the EPR as a collection of
      silent but consequential voices. Micro-analytic attention to the way in which
      these different voices are managed, combined with understandings drawn from
      ethnographic observation of the primary care context, reveals the EPR as
      exhibiting a previously under-explored kind of 'agency' within the consultation.

      policy - leads to a novel governance configuration in which information exchange 
      (hence governance) is affected by sector membership and interest similarity as
      opposed to anticipated financial burdens or influence reputation in the newly
      established policy domain. The study is based on a standardised survey of 29
      organisations that are involved in the implementation of the eHC. The analysis is
      carried out using quantitative methods such as social network analysis.

TI  - Diagnosis of cardiovascular abnormalities from compressed ECG: a data
      mining-based approach.
PG  - 33-9
LID - 10.1109/TITB.2010.2094197 [doi]
AB  - Usage of compressed ECG for fast and efficient telecardiology application is
      crucial, as ECG signals are enormously large in size. However, conventional ECG
      diagnosis algorithms require the compressed ECG packets to be decompressed before
      diagnosis can be performed. This added step of decompression before performing
      diagnosis for every ECG packet introduces unnecessary delay, which is undesirable
      for cardiovascular diseased (CVD) patients. In this paper, we are demonstrating
      an innovative technique that performs real-time classification of CVD. With the
      help of this real-time classification of CVD, the emergency personnel or the
      hospital can automatically be notified via SMS/MMS/e-mail when a life-threatening
      cardiac abnormality of the CVD affected patient is detected. Our proposed system 
      initially uses data mining techniques, such as attribute selection (i.e., selects
      only a few features from the compressed ECG) and expectation maximization
      (EM)-based clustering. These data mining techniques running on a hospital server 
      generate a set of constraints for representing each of the abnormalities. Then,
      the patient's mobile phone receives these set of constraints and employs a
      rule-based system that can identify each of abnormal beats in real time. Our
      experimentation results on 50 MIT-BIH ECG entries reveal that the proposed
      approach can successfully detect cardiac abnormalities (e.g., ventricular
      flutter/fibrillation, premature ventricular contraction, atrial fibrillation,
      etc.) with 97% accuracy on average. This innovative data mining technique on
      compressed ECG packets enables faster identification of cardiac abnormality
      directly from the compressed ECG, helping to build an efficient telecardiology
      diagnosis system.

PG  - 1d
AB  - There is a national focus on electronic health records (EHRs) and health
      information exchange to improve quality, efficiency, and safety across healthcare
      settings. The purpose of this study is to describe pharmacists' views and
      practices about the adoption and use of EHRs and the sharing of health
      information by pharmacists in the state of Nebraska. A U.S. mail survey of all
      pharmacists holding a Nebraska license (N = 1,953) was conducted in June-August
      2008. Only 12 percent of pharmacists indicated using an EHR. Most pharmacists (63
      percent) indicated that their pharmacy had no plans to adopt an EHR system, while
      13 percent indicated their pharmacy planned to adopt an EHR system in the future.
      Only 8 percent of respondents currently had access to EHRs for their patients
      created by other providers. Despite a national focus on electronic health
      information exchange, there remains a low uptake of EHRs by pharmacists.

TI  - Combining electronic healthcare databases in Europe to allow for large-scale drug
      safety monitoring: the EU-ADR Project.
PG  - 1-11
LID - 10.1002/pds.2053 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: In this proof-of-concept paper we describe the framework, process, and
      preliminary results of combining data from European electronic healthcare record 
      (EHR) databases for large-scale monitoring of drug safety. METHODS: Aggregated
      demographic, clinical, and prescription data from eight databases in four
      countries (Denmark, Italy, Netherlands, the UK) were pooled using a distributed
      network approach by generation of common input data followed by local aggregation
      through custom-built software, Jerboa((c)). Comparison of incidence rates of
      upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug
      (NSAID) utilization patterns were used to evaluate data harmonization and quality
      across databases. The known association of NSAIDs and UGIB was employed to
      demonstrate sensitivity of the system by comparing incidence rate ratios (IRRs)
      of UGIB during NSAID use to UGIB during all other person-time. RESULTS: The study
      population for this analysis comprised 19,647,445 individuals corresponding to
      59,929,690 person-years of follow-up. 39,967 incident cases of UGIB were
      identified during the study period. Crude incidence rates varied between 38.8 and
      109.5/100,000 person-years, depending on country and type of database, while
      age-standardized rates ranged from 25.1 to 65.4/100,000 person-years. NSAID use
      patterns were similar for databases within the same country but heterogeneous
      among different countries. A statistically significant age- and gender-adjusted
      association between use of any NSAID and increased risk for UGIB was confirmed in
      all databases, IRR from 2.0 (95%CI:1.7-2.2) to 4.3 (95%CI: 4.1-4.5). CONCLUSIONS:
      Combining data from EHR databases of different countries to identify drug-adverse
      event associations is feasible and can set the stage for changing and enlarging
      the scale for drug safety monitoring.

TI  - Populating the i2b2 database with heterogeneous EMR data: a semantic network
      approach.
PG  - 502-6
AB  - In an ongoing effort to share heterogeneous electronic medical record (EMR) data 
      in an i2b2 instance between the University Hospitals Munster and Erlangen for
      joint cancer research projects, an ontology based system for the mapping of EMR
      data to a set of common data elements has been developed. The system translates
      the mappings into local SQL scripts, which are then used to extract, transform
      and load the facts data from each EMR into the i2b2 database. By using Semantic
      Web standards, it is the authors' goal to reuse the laboriously compiled "mapping
      knowledge" in future projects, such as a comprehensive cancer ontology or even a 
      hospital-wide clinical ontology.

TI  - Can ICTs contribute to the efficiency and provide equitable access to the health 
      care system in Sub-Saharan Africa? The Mali experience.
PG  - 33-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to demonstrate from actual projects that ICT 
      can contribute to the balance of health systems in developing countries and to
      equitable access to human resources and quality health care service. Our study is
      focused on two essential elements which are: i) Capacity building and support of 
      health professionals, especially those in isolated areas using telemedicine
      tools; ii) Strengthening of hospital information systems by taking advantage of
      full potential offered by open-source software. METHODS: Our research was
      performed on the activities carried out in Mali and in part through the RAFT
      (Reseau en Afrique Francophone pour la Telemedecine) Network. We focused mainly
      on the activities of e-learning, telemedicine, and hospital information systems. 
      These include the use of platforms that work with low Internet connection
      bandwidth. With regard to information systems, our strategy is mainly focused on 
      the improvement and implementation of open-source tools. RESULTS: Several
      telemedicine application projects were reviewed including continuing online
      medical education and the support of isolated health professionals through the
      usage of innovative tools. This review covers the RAFT project for continuing
      medical education in French-speaking Africa, the tele-radiology project in Mali, 
      the "EQUI-ResHuS" project for equal access to health over ICT in Mali, The
      "Pact-e.Sante" project for community health workers in Mali. We also detailed a
      large-scale experience of an open-source hospital information system implemented 
      in Mali: "Cinz@n". CONCLUSION: We report on successful experiences in the field
      of telemedicine and on the evaluation by the end-users of the Cinz@n project, a
      pilot hospital information system in Mali. These reflect the potential of
      healthcare-ICT for Sub-Saharan African countries.

PG  - 8-14
AB  - Web 3.0 promises us smart computer services that will interact with each other
      and leverage knowledge about us and our immediate context to deliver prioritised 
      and relevant information to support decisions and actions. Healthcare must take
      advantage of such new knowledge-integrating services, in particular to support
      better co-operation between professionals of different disciplines working in
      different locations, and to enable well-informed co-operation between clinicians 
      and patients. To grasp the potential of Web 3.0 we will need well-harmonised
      semantic resources that can richly connect virtual teams and link their
      strategies to real-time and tailored evidence. Facts, decision logic, care
      pathway steps, alerts, education need to be embedded within components that can
      interact with multiple EHR systems and services consistently. Using Health
      Informatics 3.0 a patient's current situation could be compared with the outcomes
      of very similar patients (from across millions) to deliver personalised care
      recommendations. The integration of EHRs with biomedical sciences ('omics)
      research results and predictive models such as the Virtual Physiological Human
      could help speed up the translation of new knowledge into clinical practice. The 
      mission, and challenge, for Health Informatics 3.0 is to enable healthy citizens,
      patients and professionals to collaborate within a knowledge-empowered social
      network in which patient specific information and personalised real-time evidence
      are seamlessly interwoven.

TI  - Impact of generic substitution decision support on electronic prescribing
      behavior.
PG  - 681-8
LID - 10.1136/jamia.2009.002568 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of generic substitution decision support on
      electronic (e-) prescribing of generic medications. DESIGN: The authors analyzed 
      retrospective outpatient e-prescribing data from an academic medical center and
      affiliated network for July 1, 2005-September 30, 2008 using an interrupted
      time-series design to assess the rate of generic prescribing before and after
      implementing generic substitution decision support. To assess background secular 
      trends, e-prescribing was compared with a concurrent random sample of
      hand-generated prescriptions. MEASUREMENTS: Proportion of generic medications
      prescribed before and after the intervention, evaluated over time, and compared
      with a sample of prescriptions generated without e-prescribing. RESULTS: The
      proportion of generic medication prescriptions increased from 32.1% to 54.2%
      after the intervention (22.1% increase, 95% CI 21.9% to 22.3%), with no
      diminution in magnitude of improvement post-intervention. In the concurrent
      control group, increases in proportion of generic prescriptions (29.3% to 31.4%
      to 37.4% in the pre-intervention, post-intervention, and end-of-study periods,
      respectively) were not commensurate with the intervention. There was a larger
      change in generic prescribing rates among authorized prescribers (24.6%) than
      nurses (18.5%; adjusted OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.63). Two years after the
      intervention, the proportion of generic prescribing remained significantly higher
      for e-prescriptions (58.1%; 95% CI 57.5% to 58.7%) than for hand-generated
      prescriptions ordered at the same time (37.4%; 95% CI 34.9% to 39.9%) (p<0.0001).
      Generic prescribing increased significantly in every specialty. CONCLUSION:
      Implementation of generic substitution decision support was associated with
      dramatic and sustained improvements in the rate of outpatient generic
      e-prescribing across all specialties.

TI  - E-health in Australia: time to plunge into the 21st century.
PG  - 397-8
AB  - E-health is the health care buzzword of the moment, with a person-controlled
      electronic health record funded in the 2010 federal Budget and legislation to
      introduce health identifiers recently passed by Parliament. E-health can ease the
      patient journey, improve quality of care and reduce costs. Australia's health
      care system lags behind all other sectors of our economy in the use of
      computerised systems. While general practice and community pharmacy are highly
      computerised, the hospital sector is not. Adopting e-health is likely to result
      in higher quality practice, but general practice and hospitals need a mechanism
      for securely sharing patient data. Uncoordinated implementation of differing,
      incompatible systems within and between hospitals compounds a dire lack of
      national coordination of effort. Multiple funding streams and jurisdictions and
      the lack of an implementation strategy have slowed e-health development.
      Government programs underestimate the costs of change management and the need for
      training and technology. Confusion reigns about responsibilities, but governments
      must ensure connectivity between health care providers and recognise that the
      benefits will accrue into the future. The National E-Health Transition Authority 
      has developed national open-access standards, and its foundation projects and the
      National Broadband Network are now coming into place. To ensure the clinical
      relevance, utility, safety and acceptability of e-health systems, health
      professionals urgently need technical capacity and expert guidance.

TI  - Deriving consumer-facing disease concepts for family health histories using
      multi-source sampling.
PG  - 716-24
LID - 10.1016/j.jbi.2010.04.003 [doi]
AB  - The family health history has long been recognized as an effective way of
      understanding individuals' susceptibility to familial disease; yet electronic
      tools to support the capture and use of these data have been characterized as
      inadequate. As part of an ongoing effort to build patient-facing tools for
      entering detailed family health histories, we have compiled a set of concepts
      specific to familial disease using multi-source sampling. These concepts were
      abstracted by analyzing family health history data patterns in our enterprise
      data warehouse, collection patterns of consumer personal health records, analyses
      from the local state health department, a healthcare data dictionary, and
      concepts derived from genetic-oriented consumer education materials.
      Collectively, these sources yielded a set of more than 500 unique disease
      concepts, represented by more than 2500 synonyms for supporting patients in
      entering coded family health histories. We expect that these concepts will be
      useful in providing meaningful data and education resources for patients and
      providers alike.

TI  - Protection of children restrained in child safety seats in side impact crashes.
PG  - 913-23
LID - 10.1097/TA.0b013e3181e883f9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The performance of child restraint systems (CRS) in side impact motor
      vehicle crashes has been under study due to the injury and fatality burden of
      these events. Although previous research has quantified injury risk or described 
      injured body regions, safety advances require an understanding of injury
      causation. Therefore, the objective was to delineate injury causation scenarios
      for CRS-restrained children in side impacts and document probable contact points 
      in the vehicle interior. METHODS: Two in-depth crash investigation databases, the
      Crash Injury Research and Engineering Network and the Partners for Child
      Passenger Safety Study, were queried for rear-seated, CRS-restrained children in 
      side impact crashes who sustained Abbreviated Injury Scale 2+ injury. These cases
      were reviewed by a multidisciplinary team of physicians and engineers to describe
      injury patterns, injury causation, and vehicle components that contributed to the
      injuries. RESULTS: Forty-one occupants (average age, 2.6 years) met the inclusion
      criteria. Twenty-four were near side to the crash, 7 were far side, and 10 were
      center seated. The most common injuries were to the skull and brain with an
      increasing proportion of skull fracture as age increased. Head and spine injuries
      without evidence of head contact were rare but present. All thoracic injuries
      were lung contusions and no rib fractures occurred. Near-side head and face
      contacts points were along the rear vertical plane of the window and the
      horizontal plane of the window sill. Head and face contact points for center- and
      far-side occupants were along the edges of the front seat back and front seat
      head restraint. CONCLUSIONS: Head injuries are the target for injury prevention
      for children in CRS in side impact crashes. Most of these injuries are due to the
      contact; for near-side occupants, contact with the CRS structure and the door
      interior, for far- or center-seated occupants, contact with the front seat back. 
      These data are useful in developing both educational and technological
      interventions to reduce the burden of injury to these children.

TI  - Antidepressant medication use for primary care patients with and without medical 
      comorbidities: a national electronic health record (EHR) network study.
PG  - 499-508
LID - 10.3122/jabfm.2010.04.090299 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Because comorbid depression can complicate medical conditions (eg,
      diabetes), physicians may treat depression more aggressively in patients who have
      these conditions. This study examined whether primary care physicians prescribe
      antidepressant medications more often and in higher doses for persons with
      medical comorbidities. METHODS: This secondary data analysis of electronic health
      record data was conducted in the Centricity Health Care User Research Network
      (CHURN), a national network of ambulatory practices that use a common outpatient 
      electronic health record. Participants included 209 family medicine and general
      internal medicine providers in 40 primary care CHURN offices in 17 US states.
      Patients included adults with a new episode of depression that had been diagnosed
      during the period October 2006 through July 2007 (n = 1513). Prescription of
      antidepressant medication and doses of antidepressant medication were compared
      for patients with and without 6 comorbid conditions: diabetes, coronary heart
      disease, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, chronic obstructive
      pulmonary disease, and cancer. RESULTS: 20.7% of patients had at least one
      medical comorbidity whereas 5.8% had multiple comorbidities. Overall, 77% of
      depressed patients were prescribed antidepressant medication. After controlling
      for age and sex, patients with multiple comorbidities were less likely to be
      prescribed medication (adjusted odds ratio, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.35-0.96), but there
      was no significant difference by individual comorbidities. Patients with
      cerebrovascular disease were less likely to be prescribed a full dose of
      medication (adjusted odds ratio, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.08-0.88), but there were no
      differences for other comorbidities or for multiple comorbidities, and there was 
      no difference for any comorbidities in the prescription of minimally effective
      doses. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with new episodes of depression who present to a
      primary care practice are not treated more aggressively if they have medical
      comorbidities. In fact, patients with multiple comorbidities are treated somewhat
      less aggressively.

TI  - Readiness of the Belgian network of sentinel general practitioners to deliver
      electronic health record data for surveillance purposes: results of survey study.
PG  - 50
LID - 10.1186/1471-2296-11-50 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In order to proceed from a paper based registration to a surveillance
      system that is based on extraction of electronic health records (EHR), knowledge 
      is needed on the number and representativeness of sentinel GPs using a
      government-certified EHR system and the quality of EHR data for research,
      expressed in the compliance rate with three criteria: recording of home visits,
      use of prescription module and diagnostic subject headings. METHODS: Data were
      collected by annual postal surveys between 2005 and 2009 among all sentinel GPs. 
      We tested relations between four key GP characteristics (age, gender, language
      community, practice organisation) and use of a certified EHR system by
      multivariable logistic regression. The relation between EHR software package, GP 
      characteristics and compliance with three quality criteria was equally measured
      by multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: A response rate of 99% was
      obtained. Of 221 sentinel GPs, 55% participated in the surveillance without
      interruption from 2005 onwards, i.e. all five years, and 78% were participants in
      2009. Sixteen certified EHR systems were used among 91% of the Dutch and 63% of
      the French speaking sentinel GPs. The EHR software package was strongly related
      to the community and only one EHR system was used by a comparable number of
      sentinel GPs in both communities. Overall, the prescription module was always
      used and home visits were usually recorded. Uniform subject headings were only
      sometimes used and the compliance with this quality criterion was almost
      exclusively related to the EHR software package in use. CONCLUSIONS: The
      challenge is to progress towards a sentinel network of GPs delivering care-based 
      data that are (partly) extracted from well performing EHR systems and still
      representative for Belgian general practice.

TI  - Social network analysis of medication advice-seeking interactions among staff in 
      an Australian hospital.
PG  - e116-25
LID - 10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2008.08.005 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To examine the medication advice-seeking network of staff in a hospital 
      ward. METHODS: Social network analysis was carried out in a renal ward of an
      Australian metropolitan teaching hospital. The medication advice-seeking
      interactions of doctors, nurses, allied health professionals (including a
      pharmacist) and a ward clerk were examined using data from questionnaires
      administered to staff. The questionnaire listed all staff who worked in the ward 
      and sought information from respondents regarding their interactions with each
      staff member. Data were analysed using social network software, UCINET. Analyses 
      performed included geodesic distance, network density, strength of ties,
      reciprocation of relations, and centrality of individuals. NetDraw was used to
      produce social network diagrams. RESULTS: A very high response rate of 96% was
      achieved with 45 of 47 staff returning the questionnaire. On average, there is
      little interaction between each of the staff members in the medication
      advice-seeking network, with even less interaction between staff from different
      professional groups. Nurses are mainly located on one side of the network and
      doctors on the other. However, the pharmacist is quite central in the medication 
      advice-seeking network as are some senior nurses and a junior doctor.
      CONCLUSIONS: When hospital clinical staff seek medication advice from other
      members of a ward it tends to be sought from those in their profession. However
      key individuals in the ward are relied upon for the provision of medication
      advice by staff from all professions. Social network analysis can be used to
      examine the complex medication advice-seeking interactions amongst staff in a
      hospital ward, providing useful quantitative baseline data against which to
      compare the effect of interventions, such as an electronic medication system, on 
      interactions.

      a second invitational symposium in June 2009 through its Developing Evidence to
      Inform Decisions About Effectiveness (DEcIDE) network. A distinguished Planning
      Committee set the agenda, reviewed more than 70 abstracts, and invited almost 30 
      speakers; the program emphasized issues of clinical heterogeneity and
      longitudinal outcomes, including patient-reported measures. RESULTS: Conference
      papers covered a varied set of points about 3 major areas of CER: study design
      and data collection issues; statistical and analytic techniques; and applications
      to policy and clinical decision-making. Both primary data collection and analyses
      of databases (including electronic health records and distributed networks) are
      crucial for the CER agenda. Methods advances enable investigators to pay greater 
      attention to important population subgroups, including persons of low literacy,
      non-English speaking patients, or the frail elderly. Both established and newer
      statistical techniques--eg, propensity scoring and various types of modeling,
      including Bayesian approaches--offer analysts improved ways to address issues
      such as confounding and measurement bias. Finally, some articles provided
      guidance for and examples of extending CER into newer realms, such as evaluations
      of medical devices or surgical procedures, and providing better information for
      decision-makers, clinicians, and patients.

TI  - Validation of The Health Improvement Network (THIN) primary care database for
      monitoring prescriptions for smoking cessation medications.
PG  - 586-90
LID - 10.1002/pds.1960 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Evaluation of tobacco policy requires high quality and timely data on
      smoking cessation behaviour in the general population and in relevant target
      groups. Electronic primary care databases have the potential to provide a
      valuable source of data due to their size and continuity, and the availability of
      demographic and socioeconomic data. We therefore sought to investigate whether
      The Health Improvement Network (THIN) prescribing data are complete and can
      therefore be used to monitor trends in the prescribing of smoking cessation
      medications. METHODS: The THIN smoking cessation medication prescriptions data
      for England were compared with smoking cessation medication dispensing data from 
      NHS Prescription Services for January 2004 to December 2005. RESULTS: Throughout 
      the period the rates of prescribing and dispensing were very similar, both for
      nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and bupropion combined, and for each type of
      medication alone. For NRT, dispensing exceeded recorded GP prescribing by 5.5%
      during the study period. For bupropion, prescribing exceeded dispensing by 5%.
      CONCLUSIONS: THIN prescribing and national dispensing data are highly comparable.
      THIN prescribing data could potentially be used to monitor longitudinal trends in
      prescribing for smoking cessation medications.

TI  - A community-level effort to motivate physician participation in the National
      Committee for Quality Assurance Diabetes Physician Recognition Program.
PG  - 131-8
LID - 10.1089/pop.2009.0035 [doi]
AB  - This article presents the results of an exploratory case study that assessed a
      multistakeholder alliance's initiative to motivate quality improvement in primary
      care physician (PCP) practices. The initiative utilized a "pay-for participation"
      strategy that provided incentives to PCPs to participate in the National
      Committee for Quality Assurance's Diabetes Physician Recognition Program (DPRP). 
      The intervention took place over a 2-year period in 8 practices with large
      safety-net populations located in the Rochester, New York area. The outcomes of
      interest were receipt of DPRP recognition and performance on DPRP measurements by
      the practices, as well as qualitative information regarding practice decisions
      about quality improvement. Of 79 physicians who participated, 37 (47%) received
      DPRP recognition. Receipt of recognition was likely the result of a combination
      of preexisting performance and improvements in processes made during the project.
      While sample size prevented hypothesis testing, size of practice was unrelated to
      receipt of DPRP recognition. All practices with an electronic medical record and 
      a patient registry achieved recognition. Strong physician leadership and the
      presence of a quality improvement infrastructure were believed to be associated
      with DPRP recognition. The majority of practices cited the program's honorarium
      and other incentives as key motivators for participation. Our findings suggest
      that pay-for-participation may be a viable strategy to promote quality
      improvement in physician practices. However, absent continuing reinforcement, it 
      is uncertain if such programs can lead to sustained quality improvement
      activities.

TI  - Social networks and physician adoption of electronic health records: insights
      from an empirical study.
PG  - 328-36
LID - 10.1136/jamia.2009.000877 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study how social interactions influence physician adoption of an
      electronic health records (EHR) system. DESIGN: A social network survey was used 
      to delineate the structure of social interactions among 40 residents and 15
      attending physicians in an ambulatory primary care practice. Social network
      analysis was then applied to relate the interaction structures to individual
      physicians' utilization rates of an EHR system. MEASUREMENTS: The social network 
      survey assessed three distinct types of interaction structures: professional
      network based on consultation on patient care-related matters; friendship network
      based on personal intimacy; and perceived influence network based on a person's
      perception of how other people have affected her intention to adopt the EHR
      system. EHR utilization rates were measured as the proportion of patient visits
      in which sentinel use events consisting of patient data documentation or
      retrieval activities were recorded. The usage data were collected over a time
      period of 14 months from computer-recorded audit trail logs. RESULTS: Neither the
      professional nor the perceived influence network is correlated with EHR usage.
      The structure of the friendship network significantly influenced individual
      physicians' adoption of the EHR system. Residents who occupied similar social
      positions in the friendship network shared similar EHR utilization rates
      (p<0.05). In other words, residents who had personal friends in common tended to 
      develop comparable levels of EHR adoption. This effect is particularly prominent 
      when the mutual personal friends of these 'socially similar' residents were
      attending physicians (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Social influence affecting physician
      adoption of EHR seems to be predominantly conveyed through interactions with
      personal friends rather than interactions in professional settings.

TI  - Theorising big IT programmes in healthcare: strong structuration theory meets
      actor-network theory.
PG  - 1285-94
LID - 10.1016/j.socscimed.2009.12.034 [doi]
AB  - The UK National Health Service is grappling with various large and controversial 
      IT programmes. We sought to develop a sharper theoretical perspective on the
      question "What happens - at macro-, meso- and micro-level - when government tries
      to modernise a health service with the help of big IT?" Using examples from data 
      fragments at the micro-level of clinical work, we considered how structuration
      theory and actor-network theory (ANT) might be combined to inform empirical
      investigation. Giddens (1984) argued that social structures and human agency are 
      recursively linked and co-evolve. ANT studies the relationships that link people 
      and technologies in dynamic networks. It considers how discourses become
      inscribed in data structures and decision models of software, making certain
      network relations irreversible. Stones' (2005) strong structuration theory (SST) 
      is a refinement of Giddens' work, systematically concerned with empirical
      research. It views human agents as linked in dynamic networks of
      position-practices. A quadripartite approcach considers [a] external social
      structures (conditions for action); [b] internal social structures (agents'
      capabilities and what they 'know' about the social world); [c] active agency and 
      actions and [d] outcomes as they feed back on the position-practice network. In
      contrast to early structuration theory and ANT, SST insists on disciplined
      conceptual methodology and linking this with empirical evidence. In this paper,
      we adapt SST for the study of technology programmes, integrating elements from
      material interactionism and ANT. We argue, for example, that the
      position-practice network can be a socio-technical one in which technologies in
      conjunction with humans can be studied as 'actants'. Human agents, with their
      complex socio-cultural frames, are required to instantiate technology in social
      practices. Structurally relevant properties inscribed and embedded in
      technological artefacts constrain and enable human agency. The fortunes of
      healthcare IT programmes might be studied in terms of the interplay between these
      factors.

TI  - [The compression and storage of enhanced external counterpulsation waveform based
      on DICOM standard].
PG  - 411-5
AB  - The development of external counterpulsation (ECP) local area network system and 
      extensible markup language (XML)-based remote ECP medical information system
      conformable to digital imaging and communications in medicine (DICOM) standard
      has been improving the digital interchangeablity and sharability of ECP data.
      However, the therapy process of ECP is a continuous and longtime supervision
      which builds a mass of waveform data. In order to reduce the storage space and
      improve the transmission efficiency, the waveform data with the normative format 
      of ECP data files have to be compressed. In this article, we introduced the
      compression arithmetic of template matching and improved quick fitting of linear 
      approximation distance thresholding (LADT) in combimation with the characters of 
      enhanced external counterpulsation (EECP) waveform signal. The DICOM standard is 
      used as the storage and transmission standard to make our system compatible with 
      hospital information system. According to the rules of transfer syntaxes, we
      defined private transfer syntax for one-dimensional compressed waveform data and 
      stored EECP data into a DICOM file. Testing result indicates that the compressed 
      and normative data can be correctly transmitted and displayed between EECP
      workstations in our EECP laboratory.

TI  - The representativeness of sentinel practice networks.
PG  - 90-6
LID - 10.1093/pubmed/fdp087 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The representativeness of practice networks is important when using
      the information obtained to guide health policy. AIM: To develop a model for
      examining the representativeness of practice networks. METHODS: Comparison of
      surveyed population, practice structure and prescribing characteristics with the 
      national data using the Weekly Returns Service (WRS) for 2006 as an example of
      practice network. The population monitored was compared with the national PCT
      population. The practice postcode was linked to the Index of Multiple Deprivation
      and the distribution compared with the national equivalents. Doctor and
      practice-specific structural data (obtained by questionnaire) and
      practice-prescribing data were compared with the national equivalents. The
      significance of differences was evaluated using non-parametric tests. RESULTS:
      The WRS population was closely matched with the national data by age, gender and 
      deprivation index. Compared with the national equivalents, WRS practices,
      included more younger GPs, had a larger average list per GP and fewer practices
      with a list of less than 1499 per GP. Prescribing patterns were similar to their 
      PCT equivalents excepting for small reductions of antibacterial prescribing
      (items 7% and cost 5%). CONCLUSION: We demonstrate a low-cost model methodology
      for examining the representativeness of practice networks using independent data 
      with minimum practice input.

TI  - Development of traditional Chinese medicine clinical data warehouse for medical
      knowledge discovery and decision support.
PG  - 139-52
LID - 10.1016/j.artmed.2009.07.012 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is a scientific discipline, which
      develops the related theories from the long-term clinical practices. The
      large-scale clinical data are the core empirical knowledge source for TCM
      research. This paper introduces a clinical data warehouse (CDW) system, which
      incorporates the structured electronic medical record (SEMR) data for medical
      knowledge discovery and TCM clinical decision support (CDS). MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: We have developed the clinical reference information model (RIM) and
      physical data model to manage the various information entities and their
      relationships in TCM clinical data. An extraction-transformation-loading (ETL)
      tool is implemented to integrate and normalize the clinical data from different
      operational data sources. The CDW includes online analytical processing (OLAP)
      and complex network analysis (CNA) components to explore the various clinical
      relationships. Furthermore, the data mining and CNA methods are used to discover 
      the valuable clinical knowledge from the data. RESULTS: The CDW has integrated
      20,000 TCM inpatient data and 20,000 outpatient data, which contains
      manifestations (e.g. symptoms, physical examinations and laboratory test
      results), diagnoses and prescriptions as the main information components. We
      propose a practical solution to accomplish the large-scale clinical data
      integration and preprocessing tasks. Meanwhile, we have developed over 400 OLAP
      reports to enable the multidimensional analysis of clinical data and the
      case-based CDS. We have successfully conducted several interesting data mining
      applications. Particularly, we use various classification methods, namely support
      vector machine, decision tree and Bayesian network, to discover the knowledge of 
      syndrome differentiation. Furthermore, we have applied association rule and CNA
      to extract the useful acupuncture point and herb combination patterns from the
      clinical prescriptions. CONCLUSION: A CDW system consisting of TCM clinical RIM, 
      ETL, OLAP and data mining as the core components has been developed to facilitate
      the tasks of TCM knowledge discovery and CDS. We have conducted several OLAP and 
      data mining tasks to explore the empirical knowledge from the TCM clinical data. 
      The CDW platform would be a promising infrastructure to make full use of the TCM 
      clinical data for scientific hypothesis generation, and promote the development
      of TCM from individualized empirical knowledge to large-scale evidence-based
      medicine.

TI  - Health information exchange in small-to-medium sized family medicine practices:
      motivators, barriers, and potential facilitators of adoption.
PG  - 123-9
LID - 10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2009.12.001 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: For small-to-medium sized primary care practices (those with 20 or fewer
      clinicians), determine desired functions of health information exchange (HIE) and
      potential motivators, barriers, and facilitators of adoption. METHODS: Case study
      approach with mixed quantitative and qualitative methods. Nine practices in
      Colorado were purposively selected. Five used paper records and four were already
      participating in health information exchange. RESULTS: Practices particularly
      desired HIE functions to allow anywhere/anytime lookup of test results and to
      consolidate delivery of test results. HIE-generated quality reporting was the
      least desired function. Practices were motivated to adopt HIE to improve the
      quality and efficiency of care, although they did not anticipate financial gains 
      from adoption. The greatest facilitator of HIE adoption would be technical
      assistance and support during and after implementation. Financial incentives were
      also valued. Trust in HIE partners was a major issue, and practices with rich
      professional and social networks appeared to be especially favorable settings for
      HIE adoption. CONCLUSIONS: These findings may assist policymakers in promoting
      adoption of HIE among small-to-medium sized primary care practices, a major
      component of the US healthcare system.

TI  - Integrated heart failure telemonitoring system for homecare.
PG  - 200-4
AB  - The integrated telemonitoring system (ITS) for homecare has been designed to
      improve quality of care as measured by increased nursing productivity, improved
      patients' clinical and behavioral outcomes and reduction of cost. The system
      incorporates managerial, organizational, operational and clinical tasks optimized
      for delivery of quality care through telemonitoring. A secure, multi-modal
      computer network that integrates homecare nurses, patients and those who care
      into one seamless environment has been developed. The network brings together a
      new generation of small, hand-held, wireless terminals used by nurses and
      patients with a HIPPA-compliant electronic patient record system at the
      caregiver's site. Wireless terminals use Gobi multi-standard networking
      technology for connectivity to any available wireless network. The unique
      features of ITS include a) picture recognition technology capable of extracting
      numeric data from in-home physiological signal monitor displays that include
      blood pressure, weight, oxygen saturation, transmission of lung sounds, and
      capturing echocardiography and electrocardiography data from mobile units; b)
      in-home caregiver-assisted interactive examinations of signs and symptoms that
      include visual impressions of ankle swelling, jugular vein distension
      measurement, and weight gain; c) video-conference capability, facilitating
      face-to-face two-way communication of nursing personnel with the patients. The
      ITS network has been designed to improve patients' clinical and behavioral
      outcomes, increase nursing productivity, and reduce the cost of homecare.
      Patients' co-operation and compliance has been achieved through use of
      easy-to-use videoconferencing terminals.

AB  - Recording a personal life log (PLL) of daily activities is an emerging technology
      for u-lifecare and e-health services. In this paper, we present an
      accelerometer-based personal life log system capable of human activity
      classification and exercise information generation. In our system, we use a
      tri-axial accelerometer and a real-time activity recognition scheme in which a
      set of augmented features of accelerometer signals, processed with Linear
      Discriminant Analysis (LDA), is classified by our hierarchical artificial neural 
      network classifier: in the lower level of the classifier, a state of an activity 
      is recognized based on the statistical and spectral features; in the upper level,
      an activity is recognized with a set of augmented features including
      autoregressive (AR) coefficients, signal magnitude area (SMA), and tilt angles
      (TA). Upon the recognition of each activity, we further estimate exercise
      information such as energy expenditure based on Metabolic Equivalents (METS),
      step count, walking distance, walking speed, activity duration, etc. Our PLL
      system functions in real-time and all information generated from our system is
      archived in a daily-log database. By testing our system on seven different daily 
      activities, we have obtained an average accuracy of 84.8% in activity recognition
      and generated their relative exercise information.

TI  - The Bay Area HIE. A case study in connecting stakeholders.
PG  - 25-30
AB  - The core philosophy of health information exchanges is to bring together industry
      stakeholders to facilitate the movement of actionable healthcare information
      within or across organizations. One workable model for automating the HIE is the 
      virtual health exchange. It allows an organization to satisfy its electronic data
      exchange needs, while positioning it for HIO/RHIO and Nationwide Health
      Information Network inclusion. Four healthcare organizations in the San Francisco
      bay area offer a unique case study of this emerging model and a distinctive
      technology strategy using HIPAA-compliant SaaS online connectivity. The article
      will explore the foundational elements such as platform connectivity solutions
      and services that meet the federal HIT Policy Committee's approved recommendation
      of "meaningful use" 2011 criteria for exchange health information. Several
      ambulatory solutions are integrated into the data and workflow. The Bay Area HIE 
      consists of John Muir Health, a private health system; Hill Physicians Medical
      Group, an independent physicians' organization; Alta Bates Medical Group, a
      600-physician IPA; San Ramon Regional Medical Center, a 123-bed, acute-care
      hospital; and University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), a large academic
      health system. Collectively, 2,800-plus physicians, 900,000 patients, numerous
      reference labs and interoperability among several health IT vendors are involved.
      Providers and hospitals are exchanging data and 136,000 patients have connected
      online to their records. Connected physicians have access to online services,
      e.g., results management, messaging, colleague-to-colleague messaging, referrals,
      and eprescribing. Patients are offered secure messaging, including preventive
      care reminders, PHRs, lab results, script renewals, bill payment, appointment
      requests, referrals and education services. Revealed are resulting care
      coordination and practice operational improvements.

TI  - The Information Quality Triangle: a methodology to assess clinical information
      quality.
PG  - 699-703
AB  - Building qualitative clinical decision support or monitoring based on information
      stored in clinical information (or EHR) systems cannot be done without assessing 
      and controlling information quality. Numerous works have introduced methods and
      measures to qualify and enhance data, information models and terminologies
      quality. This paper introduces an approach based on an Information Quality
      Triangle that aims at providing a generic framework to help in characterizing
      quality measures and methods in the context of the integration of EHR data in a
      clinical datawarehouse. We have successfully experimented the proposed approach
      at the HEGP hospital in France, as part of the DebugIT EU FP7 project.

TI  - Measuring use of electronic health record functionality using system audit
      information.
PG  - 86-90
AB  - Meaningful and efficient methods for measuring Electronic Health Record (EHR)
      adoption and functional usage patterns have recently become important for
      hospitals, clinics, and health care networks in the United State due to recent
      government initiatives to increase EHR use. To date, surveys have been the method
      of choice to measure EHR adoption. This paper describes another method for
      measuring EHR adoption which capitalizes on audit logs, which are often common
      components of modern EHRs. An Audit Data Mart is described which identified EHR
      functionality within 836 Departments, within 22 Hospitals and 170 clinics at
      Intermountain Healthcare, a large integrated delivery system. The Audit Data Mart
      successfully identified important and differing EHR functional usage patterns.
      These patterns were useful in strategic planning, tracking EHR implementations,
      and will likely be utilized to assist in documentation of "Meaningful Use" of EHR
      functionality.

AB  - For the past decade, adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) has been
      proposed as one of the most viable approaches to improving the United States
      health care system. Although there is evidence that EHR adoption is slowly
      progressing, current methods of assessing adoption have yielded significant
      variance in estimates of EHR utilization. We conducted an environmental scan
      consisting of a review of the literature as well as a series of discussions with 
      health center and health center network representatives and experts in the field 
      to understand the current state of EHR adoption and use in the United States and 
      assess the feasibility of developing a systematic approach to tracking EHR usage.

TI  - Expectations outpace reality: physicians' use of care management tools for
      patients with chronic conditions.
PG  - 1-4
AB  - Use of care management tools--such as group visits or patient registries--varies 
      widely among primary care physicians whose practices care for patients with four 
      common chronic conditions--asthma, diabetes, congestive heart failure and
      depression--according to a new national study by the Center for Studying Health
      System Change (HSC). For example, less than a third of these primary care
      physicians in 2008 reported their practices use nurse managers to coordinate
      care, and only four in 10 were in practices using registries to keep track of
      patients with chronic conditions. Physicians also used care management tools for 
      patients with some chronic conditions but not others. Practice size and setting
      were strongly related to the likelihood that physicians used care management
      tools, with solo and smaller group practices least likely to use care management 
      tools. The findings suggest that, along with experimenting with financial
      incentives for primary care physicians to adopt care management tools, policy
      makers might consider developing community-level care management resources, such 
      as nurse managers, that could be shared among smaller physician practices.

TI  - Assuring the privacy and security of transmitting sensitive electronic health
      information.
PG  - 516-20
AB  - The interchange of electronic health records between healthcare providers and
      public health organizations has become an increasingly desirable tool in reducing
      healthcare costs, improving healthcare quality, and protecting population health.
      Assuring privacy and security in nationwide sharing of Electronic Health Records 
      (EHR) in an environment such as GRID has become a top challenge and concern. The 
      Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) and The Science Application
      International Corporation (SAIC) have jointly conducted a proof of concept study 
      to find and build a common secure and reliable messaging platform (the SRM
      Platform) to handle this challenge. The SRM Platform is built on the open
      standards of OASIS, World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) web-services standards, and
      Web Services Interoperability (WS-I) specifications to provide the secure
      transport of sensitive EHR or electronic medical records (EMR). Transmitted data 
      may be in any digital form including text, data, and binary files, such as
      images. This paper identifies the business use cases, architecture, test results,
      and new connectivity options for disparate health networks among PHIN, NHIN,
      Grid, and others.

TI  - Trends in waiting list registration for liver transplantation for viral hepatitis
      in the United States.
PG  - 1680-6
LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2009.07.047 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: In the last decade, significant progress has been made in the 
      treatment of liver disease associated with chronic hepatitis, especially in
      patients infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV). To investigate whether the
      population-wide application of antiviral therapies has impacted liver transplant 
      waiting list registration, we analyzed longitudinal trends in waiting list
      registration for patients with hepatitis B and C and those with nonviral liver
      disease. METHODS: This study represented a retrospective analysis of registry
      data containing all US liver transplant centers. All adult, primary liver
      transplantation candidates registered to the Organ Procurement and
      Transplantation Network between 1985 and 2006 were included in the analysis.
      Standardized incidence rates were calculated for waiting list registration for
      liver transplantation by underlying disease (HBV and HCV infection and other) and
      by indication for transplantation (fulminant liver disease, hepatocellular
      carcinoma [HCC], and end-stage liver disease [ESLD]). RESULTS: Of 113,927 unique 
      waiting list registrants, 4793 (4.2%) had HBV, and 40,923 (35.9%) had HCV
      infections; the remaining 68,211 (59.9%) had neither. The incidence of waiting
      list registration for ESLD and fulminant liver disease decreased, whereas that
      for HCC increased. The decrease in ESLD registration was most pronounced, and the
      increase in HCC was least dramatic among registrants with hepatitis B. The
      decrease in registration for ESLD secondary to HCV infection was also
      significantly larger than that for ESLD patients with nonviral etiologies.
      CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of liver transplantation waiting list registration among
      patients with hepatitis B suggests that the widespread application of oral
      antiviral therapy for HBV contributed to the decreased incidence of decompensated
      liver disease.

TI  - Mutual information preconditioning improves structure learning of Bayesian
      networks from medical databases.
PG  - 984-9
LID - 10.1109/TITB.2009.2026273 [doi]
AB  - Bayesian networks (BNs) represent one of the most successful tools for medical
      diagnosis, selection of the optimal treatment, and prediction of the treatment
      outcome. In this paper, we present an algorithm for BN structure learning, which 
      is a variation of the standard search-and-score approach. The proposed algorithm 
      overcomes the creation of redundant network structures that may include
      nonsignificant connections between variables. In particular, the algorithm finds 
      what relationships between the variables must be prevented, by exploiting the
      binarization of a square matrix containing the mutual information (MI) among all 
      pairs of variables. Two different binarization methods are implemented. The first
      one is based on the maximum relevance minimum redundancy selection strategy. The 
      second one uses a threshold. The MI binary matrix is exploited as a
      preconditioning step for the subsequent greedy search procedure that optimizes
      the network score, reducing the number of possible search paths in the greedy
      search. Our algorithm has been tested on two different medical datasets and
      compared against the standard search-and-score algorithm as implemented in the
      DEAL package.

PG  - 392-402
LID - 10.3961/jpmph.2009.42.6.392 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aims of this paper were to develop the composite deprivation
      index (CDI) for the sub-district (Eup-Myen-Dong) levels based on the theory of
      social exclusion and to explore the relationship between the CDI and the
      standardized mortality ratio (SMR). METHODS: The paper calculated the age
      adjusted SMR and we included five dimensions of social exclusion for CDI;
      unemployment, poverty, housing, labor and social network. The proxy variables of 
      the five dimensions were the proportion of unemployed males, the percent of
      recipients receiving National Basic Livelihood Security Act benefits, the
      proportion of households under the minimum housing standard, the proportion of
      people with a low social class and the proportion of single-parent household. All
      the variables were standardized using geometric transformation and then we summed
      up them for a single index. The paper utilized the 2004-2006 National Death
      Registry data, the 2003-2006 national residents' registration data, the 2005
      Population Census data and the 2005-2006 means-tested benefit recipients' data.
      RESULTS: The figures were 115.6, 105.8 and 105.1 for the CDI of metropolitan
      areas (big cities), middle size cities and rural areas, respectively. The
      distributional variation of the CDI was the highest in metropolitan areas (8.9 - 
      353.7) and the lowest was in the rural areas (26.8 - 209.7). The extent and
      relative differences of deprivation increased with urbanization. Compared to the 
      Townsend and Carstairs index, the CDI better represented the characteristics of
      rural deprivation. The correlation with the SMR was statistically significant and
      the direction of the CDI effects on the SMR was in accordance with that of the
      previous studies. CONCLUSIONS: The study findings indicated mortality
      inequalities due to the difference in the CDI. Despite the attempt to improve
      deprivation measures, further research is warranted for the consensus development
      of a deprivation index.

TI  - Severity of injury and outcomes among obese trauma patients with fractures of the
      femur and tibia: a crash injury research and engineering network study.
PG  - 634-9
LID - 10.1097/BOT.0b013e3181a7f06c [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To understand the influence of obesity on the morbidity and mortality 
      outcomes of patients who have sustained fractures of the femur and tibia. DESIGN:
      Retrospective review. SETTING: Multicenter level I trauma facilities.
      PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS: Motor vehicle crash victims enrolled in multicenter
      databases were reviewed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Outcome measurements for
      obese (body mass index, BMI > or = 30 kg/m) versus nonobese (BMI < 30 kg/m)
      patients included Injury Severity Score, Abbreviated Injury Scores, OTA fracture 
      types, length of hospital stay, disposition, complications, and 36-Item Short
      Form Survey Instrument. RESULTS: We included 665 cases from the database, of
      which 461 (69%) were nonobese and 204 (31%) were obese. There was no difference
      in sex, mechanism of injury, Injury Severity Score, and Abbreviated Injury Score.
      The obese population was older with a mean age of 44 years compared with 41 years
      for the nonobese (P < 0.01) and had a greater incidence of reported baseline
      cardiac disease (P < 0.01) and diabetes (P < 0.01). Obese patients had more
      severe injury patterns (OTA B and C type) in the distal femur fractures (90%
      versus 61%, P < 0.01). Mortality rates did not show a statistically significant
      difference (5.6% versus 9.4%, P = 0.07). The baseline physical component on the
      36-Item Short Form Survey Instrument was lower among the obese but not
      statistically different (P = 0.08). At 6 and 12 months post injury, a decline was
      noted in both groups; however, no differential decline was noted between the
      groups (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Obese patients are significantly more likely to
      have more severe distal femur fractures compared with nonobese when involved in
      motor vehicle crashes. In this study, there was no statistically significant
      difference in length of stay, complications, or mortality in obese patients.

      Medicine 2.0: mentalities, approaches, and medical practices are changing, thanks
      to greater access to information, communal exchanges, and the comparison of
      personal experiences. Beyond the many wikis, blogs, and other collaborative
      tools, the site PatientsLikeMe.com stands out from the 2.0 crowd by its graphic

      the privacy of patient data. The challenges are to use these new resources to
      improve the quality of care and participate in the profound change they are
      bringing to the healthcare system.

PG  - 502-5
LID - 10.1016/j.humimm.2009.04.002 [doi]
AB  - Many studies relating flow cytometery crossmatch (FCXM) results to kidney
      transplant outcomes have examined risk in the first 3 to 12 months. We used Organ
      Procurement and Transplant Network registry data for 66,594 kidney transplants
      from 1995 to 2007 to investigate associations of T-cell positive (T+) and T-cell 
      negative/B-cell positive (T(-)B+) FCXM with graft failure risk early (years 0-1) 
      and late (years >1-5) after transplant. Compared with transplants with T-cell
      negative/B-cell negative (T(-)B(-)) FCXM, living-donor transplants performed
      after T+ FCXM had significantly higher adjusted, relative risks of both early
      (adjusted hazards ratio [aHR] 1.71, p < 0.0001) and late (aHR 1.36, p = 0.017)
      graft loss. T(-)B+ FCXM was associated with approximately 40% higher relative
      risk of graft loss in the late period only. Patterns were similar for
      deceased-donor transplants. The risks of positive FCXM persist beyond the
      peritransplant period for years after transplant. Damage by memory effector cells
      may explain the long-term risks associated with positive FCXM.

TI  - Interoperability of electronic health records and personal health records: key
      interoperability issues associated with information exchange.
PG  - 31-7
AB  - As patients receive medical care, their clinical history may be tracked and
      recorded by multiple electronic systems developed by independent vendors. Medical
      providers might use electronic health record (EHR) software tailored to the needs
      of trained medical personnel, whereas patients may interact with personal health 
      records (PHR). The purpose of this essay is to identify the key interoperability 
      issues associated with the information exchange between these two types of
      systems and offer an approach for enhancing interoperability. This article is
      part of a series of unpublished essays titled A Community View on How Personal
      Health Records Can Improve Patient Care and Outcomes in Many Healthcare Settings,
      a collaborative project of Northern Illinois Physicians For Connectivity and the 
      Coalition for Quality and Patient Safety of Chicagoland. For further information 
      on how you can obtain copies of the complete work, contact the principle Dr.

TI  - Sharing information and data across heterogeneous e-health systems.
PG  - 454-64
LID - 10.1089/tmj.2008.0149 [doi]
AB  - Information and data sharing across heterogeneous e-health systems, focusing on
      the management of patient care, have become the backbone of modern delivery of
      sustainable telemedicine services. Information and data available to healthcare
      practitioners in such environments range from patient's medical records, stored
      in repositories at places where patients have been treated, to a variety of
      information related to medical research, pharmaceutical products, or information 
      stored within social networks of healthcare interest groups. This study sought to
      demonstrate two different approaches enabling the sharing of information/data
      across heterogeneous e-health systems: (1) Context-Aware Data Retrieval
      Architecture (CADRA), which secures the extraction and presentation of e-health
      information to users in requested format, and (2) Generic Ontology for Context
      Aware, Interoperable, and Data Sharing (Go-CID) software applications, which
      secure semantic interoperation across heterogeneous e-health data sources.
      Proof-of-concept was demonstrated in both cases, CADRA and Go-CID, to achieve
      understanding and building of knowledge about e-health environments. This study
      invites practical solutions for interoperable e-health systems.

TI  - Software architecture and engineering for patient records: current and future.
PG  - 27-34
AB  - During the "The National Forum on the Future of the Defense Health Information
      System," a track focusing on "Systems Architecture and Software Engineering"
      included eight presenters. These presenters identified three key areas of
      interest in this field, which include the need for open enterprise architecture
      and a federated database design, net centrality based on service-oriented
      architecture, and the need for focus on software usability and reusability. The
      eight panelists provided recommendations related to the suitability of
      service-oriented architecture and the enabling technologies of grid computing and
      Web 2.0 for building health services research centers and federated data
      warehouses to facilitate large-scale collaborative health care and research.
      Finally, they discussed the need to leverage industry best practices for software
      engineering to facilitate rapid software development, testing, and deployment.

TI  - Medical informatics: a model developed for diabetes education via telemedicine.
PG  - 113-9
AB  - Fast developments in information and communication technology (ICT) have made it 
      possible to develop new services for people. One of the most interesting areas is
      health care. Medical informatics is the discipline concerned with the systematic 
      processing of data, information and knowledge in medicine and health care.
      Information services, medical decision support systems and telemedicine are
      becoming important tools for medical professionals and also people who are
      interested in health related information. Medical decision support aims at
      providing health care professionals with therapy guidelines directly at the point
      of care. Telemedicine is the use of modern telecommunications and information
      technologies (IT) for the provision of clinical care to individuals at a distance
      and transmission of information to provide that care. In the present study, usage
      of IT in medicine, medical decision support systems, computerized medical
      measurements, patient education and network connectivity were described. A model 
      for risk evaluation, data collection and education of undiagnosed diabetes using 
      the world wide web (www) was presented.

TI  - Vital signs in intensive care: automatic acquisition and consolidation into
      electronic patient records.
PG  - 47-57
AB  - The integration of computer systems into clinical practice is a consequence of
      the growing sophistication of medical machinery. The fact that patient management
      in large institutions is handled by complex information systems brings about the 
      need for integration between applications on both sides. The paper describes a
      prototype for automatic data collection from intensive care devices developed at 
      Pedro Hispano Hospital in Portugal. The system acts as an application gateway
      between the network of patient monitoring devices and the general-purpose
      hospital network. The conformance to medical standards is one of the main
      concerns. The international standard Health Level 7 (HL7) has been adopted to
      import vital signs, as well as to prepare data for visualization in departmental 
      applications and to organize archives. The design has followed the administrative
      and clinical processes in the hospital closely, leading to a successful
      interaction with the health professionals. Automatic acquisition eliminates
      transcription errors, improves the quality of records and allows the assembly of 
      large electronic archives of vital sign data. The concern with data archiving in 
      standard formats opens many possibilities for further analysis of the collected
      data sets. The possibility of communicating via the HL7 standard makes the whole 
      system easily interoperable with applications in related domains.

TI  - A comparative analysis of multi-level computer-assisted decision making systems
      for traumatic injuries.
PG  - 2
LID - 10.1186/1472-6947-9-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This paper focuses on the creation of a predictive computer-assisted 
      decision making system for traumatic injury using machine learning algorithms.
      Trauma experts must make several difficult decisions based on a large number of
      patient attributes, usually in a short period of time. The aim is to compare the 
      existing machine learning methods available for medical informatics, and develop 
      reliable, rule-based computer-assisted decision-making systems that provide
      recommendations for the course of treatment for new patients, based on previously
      seen cases in trauma databases. Datasets of traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients
      are used to train and test the decision making algorithm. The work is also
      applicable to patients with traumatic pelvic injuries. METHODS: Decision-making
      rules are created by processing patterns discovered in the datasets, using
      machine learning techniques. More specifically, CART and C4.5 are used, as they
      provide grammatical expressions of knowledge extracted by applying logical
      operations to the available features. The resulting rule sets are tested against 
      other machine learning methods, including AdaBoost and SVM. The rule creation
      algorithm is applied to multiple datasets, both with and without prior filtering 
      to discover significant variables. This filtering is performed via logistic
      regression prior to the rule discovery process. RESULTS: For survival prediction 
      using all variables, CART outperformed the other machine learning methods. When
      using only significant variables, neural networks performed best. A reliable
      rule-base was generated using combined C4.5/CART. The average predictive rule
      performance was 82% when using all variables, and approximately 84% when using
      significant variables only. The average performance of the combined C4.5 and CART
      system using significant variables was 89.7% in predicting the exact outcome
      (home or rehabilitation), and 93.1% in predicting the ICU length of stay for
      airlifted TBI patients. CONCLUSION: This study creates an efficient
      computer-aided rule-based system that can be employed in decision making in TBI
      cases. The rule-bases apply methods that combine CART and C4.5 with logistic
      regression to improve rule performance and quality. For final outcome prediction 
      for TBI cases, the resulting rule-bases outperform systems that utilize all
      available variables.

TI  - Telestroke 10 years later--'telestroke 2.0'.
PG  - 323-30
LID - 10.1159/000229550 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The lack of physicians with specialty stroke training represents a
      significant challenge to the future of stroke. This deficit limits both quality
      stroke care and clinical research initiatives. METHODS: The use of telemedicine
      for stroke ('telestroke') has been an attempt to overcome this shortage and
      extend stroke expertise to locations which lack coverage. However, the initial
      telestroke systems required a point-to-point connection for transmission and only
      provided videoconferencing which limited their generalizability and usefulness.
      'Telestroke 2.0' is the authors' vision of an integrative web-based telestroke
      system combining high-quality audiovideo transmission, the ability of consults
      and teleradiology to be carried out from any desktop or laptop computer with
      web-access, decision and technical support, creation of billable physician
      documentation and electronic medical record connectivity. RESULTS: These features
      will facilitate the development of statewide and regional telestroke call
      networks with an opportunity for physician supply companies to fill in coverage
      gaps. In addition, telestroke 2.0 may improve acute stroke research by increasing
      trial efficiency via the addition of non-academic recruitment sites, enhancing
      trial validity by centralizing neurologic examinations via recorded encounters,
      and generalizing clinical trial results to community hospital settings.
      CONCLUSIONS: Greater diffusion and long-term sustainability of telestroke systems
      will be dependent upon improvements in patient and hospital reimbursement for
      acute stroke and telestroke care.

      new outpatient clinical record, 'xl'Emofilia', as part of a project 'Web
      Connections of the Region's HC' funded by Emilia-Romagna Health Authority. It is 
      a web-based application suited to the needs of HC, which shares the databases of 
      the region's HC, integrated with regional and national registries that can be
      accessed from anywhere. Data are managed with the 'https' protocol. Significant
      innovations are 'pathways' that help with the entry of data and 'problem list',
      which is a summary (updated automatically) of the patient's clinically
      significant data that can be consulted at a glance. With a 'web identity' (a
      personal USB key for secure web access), patients can record bleeds and home
      infusions, consult their own data and allow access to their general practitioners
      or in emergency departments anywhere in the world (also in English language). In 
      December 2006, the HC started to use 'xl'Emofilia' and 673 clinical records are
      now active. Since April 2007, 50 pilot patients have been trained and are
      successfully using the system. A questionnaire administered to these patients on 
      their level of satisfaction with the system and its ease of use gave excellent
      results. Our web-based system facilitates communication between patients and HC, 
      improves the quality of care and enables patients to use these information at any
      time and from anywhere in the world.

TI  - Results of a survey of an online physician community regarding use of electronic 
      medical records in office practices.
PG  - 254-6
AB  - A recent publication suggested that only 24% of U.S. doctors use electronic
      medical records (EMRs), and that physicians in group practices, urban settings,
      and multispecialty groups are more likely than others to use EMRs. If the
      widespread adoption of EMRs is to be accomplished in keeping with the President's
      Health IT goal of universal use by 2014, the reasons for EMR under-utilization
      must be ascertained and addressed. In order to assess current patterns of EMR use
      and reasons for non-use, physician opinions were surveyed directly, using an
      online social network of physicians in the United States called Sermo. In
      February 2008, 893 physician members of Sermo responded to the author's posting
      about EMR use. Their responses were notable for two reasons. First, EMR adoption 
      (not just electronic billing or prescribing) may actually be higher (67%) than
      previous reports. Second, the most important barriers to EMR use were high cost, 
      loss of autonomy, and workflow disruption (from both installation and ongoing
      use). These responses are discussed in the context of recent proposals by both
      private and public entities that EMR systems be given away for free to any
      physician who will use them, as well as the potential for patients' online
      personal health records to permit integration of data across multiple EMR
      systems.

TI  - The EU-ADR project: preliminary results and perspective.
PG  - 43-9
AB  - The EU-ADR project aims to exploit different European electronic healthcare
      records (EHR) databases for drug safety signal detection. In this paper we
      describe the project framework and the preliminary results. METHODS: As first
      step we created a ranked list of the events that are deemed to be important in
      pharmacovigilance as mining on all possible events was considered to unduly
      increase the number of spurious signals. All the drugs that are potentially
      associated to these events will be detected via data mining techniques. Data
      sources are eight 8 databases in four countries (Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands,
      and the United Kingdom) that are virtually linked through harmonisation of input 
      data followed by local elaboration of input data through custom-built software
      (Jerboa). All the identified drug-event associations (signals) will be thereafter
      biologically substantiated and epidemiologically validated. To date, only Upper
      gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) event has been used to test the ability of the
      system in signal detection. RESULTS: An initial ranked list comprising 23 adverse
      events was identified. The top-ranking events were: cutaneous bullous eruptions, 
      acute renal failure, acute myocardial infarction, anaphylactic shock, and
      rhabdomyolysis. Regarding the UGIB test, a total of 48,016 first-ever episodes
      were identified. The age-standardized incidence rates of UGIB varied between
      40-100/100,000 person-years depending on country and type of healthcare database.
      A statistically significant association between use of NSAIDs and UGIB was
      detected in all of the databases. CONCLUSION: a dynamic ranked list of 23 adverse
      drug events judged as important in pharmacovigilance was created to permit
      focused data mining. Preliminary results on the UGIB event detection demonstrate 
      the feasibility of harmonizing various health care databases in different
      European countries through a distributed network approach.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Rapid advances in digital imaging technology that characterised the
      early part of the 21 (st) century have caused modern hospital information systems
      (HIS) to face a big challenge. One of the key goals of their reorganisation is
      integration based on open standards in order to achieve optimal interoperability.
      METHODS: At the Department of Ophthalmology of the University Clinical Centre
      Maribor, we have set up an intranet integrating a variety of diagnostic
      procedures into a single network. All workstations are connected to a dedicated
      data server, which represents the core of the network. The system is compatible
      with the DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) standard and
      ready for future integration with hospital information systems over the HL 7
      (Health Level 7) protocol. RESULTS: With the integration of different systems we 
      have achieved the availability of all administrative, clinical and photo
      documentation for each patient on every workstation. This kind of system enables 
      numerous connections within different diagnostic units and workstations, which is
      most distinctive during the diagnostic work-up of complex clinical cases.
      CONCLUSIONS: At our department integration of different diagnostic units into one
      ophthalmology information system proved to be a helpful tool regarding patient
      care during diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and at the same time represents
      a reduction of burdens for the medical staff.

TI  - Auditing the NCI thesaurus with semantic web technologies.
PG  - 500-4
AB  - Auditing biomedical terminologies often results in the identification of
      inconsistencies and thus helps to improve their quality. In this paper, we
      present a method based on Semantic Web technologies for auditing biomedical
      terminologies and apply it to the NCI thesaurus. We stored the NCI thesaurus
      concepts and their properties in an RDF triple store. By querying this store, we 
      assessed the consistency of both hierarchical and associative relations from the 
      NCI thesaurus among themselves and with corresponding relations in the UMLS
      Semantic Network. We show that the consistency is better for associative
      relations than for hierarchical relations. Causes for inconsistency and benefits 
      from using Semantic Web technologies for auditing purposes are discussed.

TI  - Fuzzy temporal constraint networks for clinical information.
PG  - 374-8
AB  - Modeling the temporal information in the medical record is an important area of
      research. This paper describes an extension of TimeText, a temporal reasoning
      system designed to represent, extract, and reason about temporal information in
      clinical text, to include the use of fuzzy temporal constraints. The addition of 
      fuzzy temporal constraints increases TimeTexts ability to handle uncertainty in
      temporal relations. We use a three-state, staircase possibility distribution
      function in conjunction with earlier methods of finding solutions to fuzzy
      temporal constraint networks. We perform analysis to determine the complexity of 
      using this staircase in conjunction with finding solutions to fuzzy temporal
      constraint satisfaction problems and show that these solutions can be efficiently
      computed in O(n3).

TI  - Complexity measures to track the evolution of a SNOMED hierarchy.
PG  - 778-82
AB  - SNOMED CT is an extensive terminology with an attendant amount of complexity. Two
      measures are proposed for quantifying that complexity. Both are based on
      abstraction networks, called the area taxonomy and the partial-area taxonomy,
      that provide, for example, distributions of the relationships within a SNOMED
      hierarchy. The complexity measures are employed specifically to track the
      complexity of versions of the Specimen hierarchy of SNOMED before and after it is
      put through an auditing process. The pre-audit and post-audit versions are
      compared. The results show that the auditing process indeed leads to a
      simplification of the terminology's structure.

TI  - Telemedicine deployments within NATO military forces: a data analysis of current 
      and projected capabilities.
PG  - 946-51
LID - 10.1089/tmj.2008.0018 [doi]
AB  - Since the creation of the NATO Telemedicine Expert Panel (now renamed the TMED
      Expert Team) in 2000, when few nations had deployed telemedicine systems to
      support military field operations, this group has been encouraging the nations to
      deploy telemedicine (TMED) in support of their forces, and to write the use of
      TMED into NATO doctrine. This has been a relatively successful effort, and TMED
      is increasingly being used within the military medical structures of some NATO
      and Partnership for Peace nations to provide medical care to deployed military
      personnel. We report the results of a multinational survey of current and
      projected availability of various telemedicine modalities within the NATO medical
      services that are participating in the work of the TMED expert team (ET). Though 
      only a "snapshot in time," and not representing all NATO nations, this is the
      first attempt to identify both current and planned TMED utilization within the
      multinational military medical community. Participating nations report that
      communication systems now in place at the lowest levels of medical support
      increasingly enable the routine use of Web-based teleconsultation modalities.
      Teleradiology is now being seen as the de facto standard for imaging support.
      While a number of nations report they have deployed capabilities for obtaining
      clinical consultations at a distance, most responding nations do not have a
      formal organizational structure to control and manage remote consultation and
      rely on informal clinical relationships (e.g., requesting consults from the
      deployed clinician's home hospital or from friends). Military electronic health
      records are in use by only a minority of nations and fewer still are capable of
      civilian interface. Less common TMED capabilities (e.g., tele-microbiology,
      tele-pathology, tele-medical maintenance) are being increasingly used, but are
      still rarely deployed. As a result of the findings of this survey, specific
      recommendations for expanding the use of TMED in the NATO multinational medical
      setting have been made to appropriate NATO bodies.

TI  - The influence of vehicle damage on injury severity of drivers in head-on motor
      vehicle crashes.
PG  - 1589-94
LID - 10.1016/j.aap.2008.04.006 [doi]
AB  - Data from crashes investigated through the Crash Injury Research and Engineering 
      Network (CIREN) Program were used to assess differences in injury patterns,
      severity, and sources for drivers, protected by safety belts and deploying
      steering wheel air bags, in head-on frontal impacts. We studied whether exterior 
      vehicle damage with a different distribution (wide vs. narrow) across the front
      vehicle plane influenced injury characteristics. Drivers from both impact types
      were similar on the basis of demographic characteristics (except age), restraint 
      use, and vehicle characteristics. There were significant differences in the type 
      of object contacted and intrusion into the passenger compartment at the driver's 
      seat location. The mean delta V (based on the kilometers per hour change in
      velocity during the impact) was similar for drivers in both (wide vs. narrow)
      impact types. There were no significant differences in injury patterns and
      sources except that drivers in wide impacts were almost 4 times more likely (odds
      ratio (OR)=3.81, 95% confidence limits (CL) 1.26, 11.5) to have an abbreviated
      injury scale (AIS) 3 serious or greater severity head injury. Adjusted odds
      ratios showed that drivers in wide impacts were less likely (OR=0.54, 95% CI
      0.37, 0.79) to have severe injury (based on injury severity score (ISS)>25) when 
      controlling for intrusion, vehicle body type, vehicle curb weight, age, proper
      safety belt use, and delta V. Drivers with intrusion into their position or who
      were driving a passenger vehicle were almost twice more likely to have severe
      injury, regardless of whether the frontal plane damage distribution was wide or
      narrow. Our study supports that the type of damage distribution across the
      frontal plane may be an important crash characteristic to consider when studying 
      drivers injured in head-on motor vehicle crashes.

TI  - Evaluation of an architecture for intelligent query and exploration of
      time-oriented clinical data.
PG  - 17-34
LID - 10.1016/j.artmed.2008.03.006 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Evaluate KNAVE-II, a knowledge-based framework for visualization,
      interpretation, and exploration of longitudinal clinical data, clinical concepts 
      and patterns. KNAVE-II mediates queries to a distributed temporal-abstraction
      architecture (IDAN), which uses a knowledge-based problem-solving method
      specializing in on-the-fly computation of clinical queries. METHODS: A two-phase,
      balanced cross-over study to compare efficiency and satisfaction of a group of
      clinicians when answering queries of variable complexity about time-oriented
      clinical data, typical for oncology protocols, using KNAVE-II, versus standard
      methods: both paper charts and a popular electronic spreadsheet (ESS) in Phase I;
      an ESS in Phase II. The measurements included the time required to answer and the
      correctness of answer for each query and each complexity category, and for all
      queries, assessed versus a predetermined gold standard set by a domain expert.
      User satisfaction was assessed by the Standard Usability Score (SUS)
      tool-specific questionnaire and by a "Usability of Tool Comparison" comparative
      questionnaire developed for this study. RESULTS: In both evaluations, subjects
      answered higher-complexity queries significantly faster using KNAVE-II than when 
      using paper charts or an ESS up to a mean of 255 s difference per query versus
      the ESS for hard queries (p=0.0003) in the second evaluation. Average correctness
      scores when using KNAVE-II versus paper charts, in the first phase, and the ESS, 
      in the second phase, were significantly higher over all queries. In the second
      evaluation, 91.6% (110/120) of all of the questions asked within queries of all
      levels produced correct answers using KNAVE-II, opposed to only 57.5% (69/120)
      using the ESS (p<0.0001). User satisfaction with KNAVE-II was significantly
      superior compared to using either a paper chart or the ESS (p=0.006). Clinicians 
      ranked KNAVE-II superior to both paper and the ESS. CONCLUSIONS: An evaluation of
      the functionality and usability of KNAVE-II and its supporting knowledge-based
      temporal-mediation architecture has produced highly encouraging results regarding
      saving of physician time, enhancement of accuracy of clinical assessment, and
      user satisfaction.

AB  - I am pleased that we get to take advantage of Bridget Moorman's background,
      experience, and perspective in this installment of IT World. One of the most
      nerve-racking tasks we run into these days is getting disparate medical devices
      to talk to each other over a network. This is especially so if the device you're 
      trying to communicate with doesn't support network connectivity. Bridget shares
      her experience here not only with a great high-level view of network interfacing,
      but also with references to dig into all the grim details. She shows us a lot of 
      facets to consider when assembling such a network. You've got to convert to hit
      the ramp then translate and aggregate before gaining access to the clinical
      information system cloud. If that doesn't make sense, read on! -Jeff Kabachinski,
      IT World columnist.

TI  - Employing the electronic health record to improve diabetes care: a multifaceted
      intervention in an integrated delivery system.
PG  - 379-82
LID - 10.1007/s11606-007-0439-2 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Type 2 diabetes is one of the nation's most prevalent chronic
      diseases. Although well-known practice guidelines exist, real-life clinical
      performance often falls short of benchmarks. AIM: Employ an electronic registry
      derived from a fully integrated electronic health record (EHR) as the cornerstone
      of an intervention to improve compliance with recommended diabetes performance
      measures in an integrated practice network. SETTING: Geisinger Health System's
      network of 38 practice sites providing care to over 20,000 persons with diabetes 
      located in a 40-county region of central and northeastern Pennsylvania. PROGRAM
      DESCRIPTION: A multidisciplinary group of physicians worked to create a "bundle" 
      of best practice measures for diabetes. This measurement tool was then used as
      part of a multifaceted intervention to improve physician performance in diabetes 
      care, including audit and feedback, computerized reminders, and financial
      incentives. Changes in performance of individual measures and the total "bundle" 
      were tracked monthly over 1 year. PROGRAM EVALUATION: Significant increases were 
      seen in all measures of diabetes care over the 12-month period of the study.
      Vaccination for pneumococcal disease and influenza improved from 56.5% to 80.8%
      (p < .0001) and 55.1% to 71.0% (p < .0001), respectively. The percentage of
      patients with ideal glucose control (HBA1c < 7.0) increased from 32.2% to 34.8%
      (p < .001), and blood pressure control (<130/80) improved from 39.7% to 43.9% (p 
      < .0001). The overall number of patients receiving all 9 "bundled" measurements
      improved from 2.4% to 6.5% (p < .0001). DISCUSSION: Diabetes care improved
      significantly in response to a multifaceted intervention featuring the use of an 
      EHR-derived registry in an integrated delivery system. More work is needed to
      demonstrate that such improvements will translate into improved patient health
      outcomes.

TI  - Centers speak up: the clinical context for health information technology in the
      ambulatory care setting.
PG  - 372-8
LID - 10.1007/s11606-007-0488-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinicians in ambulatory care settings are increasingly called upon
      to use health information technology (health IT) to improve practice efficiency
      and performance. Successful adoption of health IT requires an understanding of
      how clinical tasks and workflows will be affected; yet this has not been well
      described. OBJECTIVE: To describe how health IT functions within a clinical
      context. DESIGN: Qualitative study, using in-depth, semi-structured interviews.
      PARTICIPANTS: Executives and staff at 4 community health centers, 3 health center
      networks, and 1 large primary care organization. APPROACH: Transcribed
      audio-recorded interviews, analyzed using the constant comparative method.
      RESULTS: Systematic characterization of clinical context identified 6 primary
      clinical domains. These included results management, intra-clinic communication, 
      patient education and outreach, inter-clinic coordination, medication management,
      and provider education and feedback. We generated clinical process diagrams to
      characterize these domains. Participants suggested that underlying workflows for 
      these domains must be fully operational to ensure successful deployment of health
      IT. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding the clinical context is a necessary precursor to
      successful deployment of health IT. Process diagrams can serve as the basis for
      EHR certification, to identify challenges, to measure health IT adoption, or to
      develop curricular content regarding the role of health IT in clinical practice.

AB  - The healthcare industry is recently going through extensive changes, through
      adoption of robust, interoperable healthcare information technology by means of
      electronic medical records (EMR). However, a major concern of EMR is adequate
      confidentiality of the individual records being managed electronically. Multiple 
      access points over an open network like the Internet increases possible patient
      data interception. The obligation is on healthcare providers to procure
      information security solutions that do not hamper patient care while still
      providing the confidentiality of patient information. Medical images are also
      part of the EMR which need to be protected from unauthorized users. This study
      integrates the techniques of fingerprint verification, DICOM object, digital
      signature and digital envelope in order to ensure that access to the hospital
      Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) or radiology information system
      (RIS) is only by certified parties.

AB  - Because of recent advances in wireless communication technologies, the world of
      mobile computing is flourishing with a variety of applications. In this study, we
      present an integrated architecture for a personal digital assistant (PDA)-based
      mobile medical display system that supports collaborative work between remote
      users. We aim to develop a system that enables users in different regions to
      share a working environment for collaborative visualization with the potential
      for exploring huge medical datasets. Our system consists of three major
      components: mobile client, gateway, and parallel rendering server. The mobile
      client serves as a front end and enables users to choose the visualization and
      control parameters interactively and cooperatively. The gateway handles requests 
      and responses between mobile clients and the rendering server for efficient
      communication. Through the gateway, it is possible to share working environments 
      between users, allowing them to work together in computer supported cooperative
      work (CSCW) mode. Finally, the parallel rendering server is responsible for
      performing heavy visualization tasks. Our experience indicates that some features
      currently available to our mobile clients for collaborative scientific
      visualization are limited due to the poor performance of mobile devices and the
      low bandwidth of wireless connections. However, as mobile devices and wireless
      network systems are experiencing considerable elevation in their capabilities, we
      believe that our methodology will be utilized effectively in building quite
      responsive, useful mobile collaborative medical systems in the very near future.

PG  - 614-9
LID - 10.1097/TA.0b013e318164d071 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Motor vehicle collisions are the leading cause of trauma-related
      death in the United States. Reclined seatbacks may alter crash kinetics and
      affect occupant outcome. We examined the effect of reclined seatbacks on occupant
      mortality. METHODS: Our study population consisted of United States traffic
      crashes from 1995 to 2005, using data from the Crash Injury Research and
      Engineering Network and the National Automotive Sampling System Crashworthiness
      Data System. Phase 1, we performed a detailed review of crash kinetics and
      biomechanical factors resulting in injury patterns in fully reclined occupants.
      Phase 2, we performed a population-based retrospective cohort study comparing
      outcome in upright, partial, and full recline positions. Primary outcome measure 
      was 30-day mortality. RESULTS: Phase 1, flexion and compression injuries over
      pretensioned lap and shoulder belts resulted in severe thoracoabdominal and spine
      injuries in restrained occupants, with a high associated mortality. Increased
      lower extremity injuries from additional force loads into bolsters and panels
      were also noted. Phase 2, the majority (>50%) of front-seat occupants was
      partially reclined. Fully reclined occupants were younger (30 vs. 39 years, p <
      0.0001), more likely to be male (70% vs. 49%, p < 0.0001) and less likely to wear
      a seat belt (58% vs. 78%, p < 0.0001) than upright or partially reclined
      occupants. Mortality was increased in both partially (adjusted odds ratio 1.15,
      95% confidence interval 1.05-1.26) and fully reclined occupants (adjusted odds
      ratio 1.77, 95% confidence interval 1.09-2.88). CONCLUSION: The reclined position
      is associated with increased occupant mortality in motor vehicle collisions.

TI  - [Construct a wireless clinical information system on the basis of the original
      information system].
PG  - 114-6
AB  - This article describes how to construct a integrated wireless clinical
      information system based on the original information system. It is constructed on
      the basis of the hospital HIS through the middle ware which provides a
      data-interaction platform for all the existing data and the data which would be
      added in future for various information management systems. The software system
      adopts the Web Service technology in information services. The SOAP protocol is
      applied to the data interaction between the foreground and the background. The
      mode of the network structure is "Wireless Switchboard + Intelligence antenna".
      Relying on the wireless network, the handheld data terminal and the barcode, the 
      network information can be extended to the patient bedsides and the mobile
      medical personnels.

TI  - Exploiting missing clinical data in Bayesian network modeling for predicting
      medical problems.
PG  - 1-14
AB  - When machine learning algorithms are applied to data collected during the course 
      of clinical care, it is generally accepted that the data has not been
      consistently collected. The absence of expected data elements is common and the
      mechanism through which a data element is missing often involves the clinical
      relevance of that data element in a specific patient. Therefore, the absence of
      data may have information value of its own. In the process of designing an
      application intended to support a medical problem list, we have studied whether
      the "missingness" of clinical data can provide useful information in building
      prediction models. In this study, we experimented with four methods of treating
      missing values in a clinical data set-two of them explicitly model the absence or
      "missingness" of data. Each of these data sets were used to build four different 
      kinds of Bayesian classifiers-a naive Bayes structure, a human-composed network
      structure, and two networks based on structural learning algorithms. We compared 
      the performance between groups with and without explicit models of missingness
      using the area under the ROC curve. The results showed that in most cases the
      classifiers trained using the explicit missing value treatments performed better.
      The result suggests that information may exist in "missingness" itself. Thus,
      when designing a decision support system, we suggest one consider explicitly
      representing the presence/absence of data in the underlying logic.

TI  - [Use of skills among ambulance crews assessed by ambulance on-line record-keeping
      system].
PG  - 247-51
AB  - INTRODUCTION: To fulfil the increasing requirements for documentation and quality
      assurance, amPHI, an ambulance on-line record-keeping system has been developed. 
      We present the data from the pilot study to access how often ambulance crews use 
      their skills. MATERIALS AND METHODS: As a pilot study amPHI was installed and
      tested in an emergency ambulance for 21 months. Data was entered using a computer
      with touch-enabled screen. Communication between the ambulance and the hospital
      was established through a special secured network based on the GSM mobile
      telephone network. RESULTS: The ambulance was dispatched for 830 high-priority
      services and amPHI was used in 674 cases (81%) during the pilot study. A total of
      26 out of 31 skills were used less than ten times a year per EMT (Emergency
      Medical Technician). Three of these skills--mask-ventilation, CPR (Cardio
      Pulmonary Resuscitation) and suction are technically difficult and require
      routine. CONCLUSION: The initial treatment is of prime importance for the outcome
      of the patient. It is therefore necessary to ensure that the ambulance crew is
      able to maintain their skills. In this connection amPHI can be very useful.
      Important and sometimes life-saving skills such as mask-ventilation, CPR and
      suction were used to a very limited extent. It is of great importance for the EMT
      to keep up these skills in another way. The ambulance crews are satisfied with
      the amPHI system and find it easy to use.

TI  - Co- and multimorbidity patterns in primary care based on episodes of care:
      results from the German CONTENT project.
PG  - 14
LID - 10.1186/1472-6963-8-14 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Due to technological progress and improvements in medical care and
      health policy the average age of patients in primary care is continuously
      growing. In equal measure, an increasing proportion of mostly elderly primary
      care patients presents with multiple coexisting medical conditions. To properly
      assess the current situation of co- and multimorbidity, valid scientific data
      based on an appropriate data structure are indispensable. CONTENT (CONTinuous
      morbidity registration Epidemiologic NeTwork) is an ambitious project in Germany 
      to establish a system for adequate record keeping and analysis in primary care
      based on episodes of care. An episode is defined as health problem from its first
      presentation by a patient to a doctor until the completion of the last encounter 
      for it. The study aims to describe co- and multimorbidity as well as health care 
      utilization based on episodes of care for the study population of the first
      participating general practices. METHODS: The analyses were based on a total of
      39,699 patients in a yearly contact group (YCG) out of 17 general practices in
      Germany for which data entry based on episodes of care using the International
      Classification of Primary Care (ICPC) was performed between 1.1.2006 and
      31.12.2006. In order to model the relationship between the explanatory variables 
      (age, gender, number of chronic conditions) and the response variables of
      interest (number of different prescriptions, number of referrals, number of
      encounters) that were applied to measure health care utilization, we used
      multiple linear regression. RESULTS: In comparison to gender, patients' age had a
      manifestly stronger impact on the number of different prescriptions, the number
      of referrals and number of encounters. In comparison to age (beta = 0.043, p <
      0.0001), multimorbidity measured by the number of patients' chronic conditions
      (beta = 0.51, p < 0.0001) had a manifestly stronger impact the number of
      encounters for the observation period. Moreover, we could observe that the number
      of patients' chronic conditions had a significant impact on the number of
      different prescriptions (beta = 0.226, p < 0.0001) as well as on the number of
      referrals (beta = 0.3, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Documentation in primary care on 
      the basis of episodes of care facilitates an insight to concurrently existing
      health problems and related medical procedures. Therefore, the resulting data
      provide a basis to obtain co- and multimorbidity patterns and corresponding
      health care utilization issues in order to understand the particular complex
      needs caused by multimorbidity.

TI  - BrainIT collaborative network: analyses from a high time-resolution dataset of
      head injured patients.
PG  - 223-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: The BrainIT project was conceived in 1997 and has grown into an
      international collaboration with the purpose of gathering high time resolution
      data from head injured patients utilising standardised methodologies. MATERIALS
      AND METHODS: From 1998, 22 participating neuroscience centres collected three
      main types of information: demographic, physiological data and clinical treatment
      information. A data collection solution was provided for each centre dependent on
      their existing facilities and data were collected for the duration of monitoring 
      as defined by the routine care in each centre. On completion of ICP monitoring
      all personal information was removed and then transferred to Glasgow via the
      internet where it was converted into a standard format and entered into a central
      database. Outcome was measured using the extended Glasgow Outcome Score using an 
      interview questionnaire. FINDINGS: Data has been obtained from a total of 349
      patients (277 male and 72 female) The age of these patients ranged from 1 to 87
      years (median 31); 145 had been involved in a traffic accident and 32 were
      pedestrians; 78 had suffered a fall; 24 were assaulted and the remaining 70 of
      other causes. A large amount of physiological data was collected (e.g. BP 2,531
      days, ICP 2,212 days in total). This dataset has provided the opportunity to
      perform unique analysis and these include the statistical features of blood
      pressure, diurnal variations in ICP, optimal sampling rate determination and a
      comparison of summary measures of secondary insults. CONCLUSIONS: This
      challenging collaboration has brought together a large number of centres and
      developed a successful clinical research network focussed on improving the
      treatment of head injured patients. It has successfully collected a vast quantity
      of high quality data that provides a rich source for analysis and hypothesis
      testing.

TI  - Medical Image distribution and visualization in a hospital using CORBA.
PG  - 1490-3
LID - 10.1109/IEMBS.2008.4649450 [doi]
AB  - In this work it is presented the solution adopted by the Heart Institute (InCor) 
      of Sao Paulo for medical image distribution and visualization inside the
      hospital's intranet as part of the PACS system. A CORBA-based image server was
      developed to distribute DICOM images across the hospital together with the
      images' report. The solution adopted allows the decoupling of the server
      implementation and the client. This gives the advantage of reusing the same
      solution in different implementation sites. Currently, the PACS system is being
      used on two different hospitals each one with three different environments:
      development, prototype and production.

TI  - Depressed and a co-morbid condition: more psychotropics prescribed!
PG  - 10-8
LID - 10.1080/13814780701855724 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Depression often occurs simultaneously with a variety of somatic,
      psychiatric, and social conditions. Knowledge about differences in the
      pharmacological treatment of depressed patients with and without co-morbidity is 
      lacking. OBJECTIVE: To compare GPs' pharmacological treatment of depressed
      patients with and without co-morbidity. METHODS: Data were extracted from the
      computerized medical records of 77 general practices participating in the Dutch
      National Information Network of General Practice (LINH). We used diagnosis and
      prescription data of newly diagnosed depressed patients aged 18-65 years
      (n=4372). A mixed-model technique was used for analyzing the medical data.
      RESULTS: During the year after diagnosing depression, depressed patients who also
      suffered from chronic somatic or psychiatric morbidity were prescribed more
      psychotropics than patients with depression only. Prescription patterns of
      psychotropic drugs for depressed patients with and without co-morbid social
      problems differed only during the first 3 months after diagnosis. For the whole
      1-year period after diagnosis, the pharmacological treatment of depression in
      patients with and without co-morbid social problems did not differ. CONCLUSION:
      Our results indicate that chronic somatic or psychiatric co-morbidity in
      depressed patients leads to higher GP prescription levels of psychotropics,
      whereas co-morbid social problems do not seem to influence GPs' pharmacological
      treatment decisions for depression.

TI  - Security, safety, and related technology - the triangle of eHealth service
      provision.
PG  - 709-14
AB  - The developing of innovative solutions in the emerging eHealth market requires
      strong economic efforts which may be justified only in presence of particularly
      suitable boundary conditions. Among the factors retained of primary importance
      for the development of eHealth, a correct approach to id-management is
      unanimously considered fundamental. Three keywords in the id-management context
      appear particularly important: standardization, security and safety.
      Standardization may contribute to increase the size and duration of the eHealth
      market, while security and safety may encourage all the stakeholders to trust in 
      a appropriate and safe management of all the very sensitive personal data
      involved in the eHealth applications. The aim of the present paper is analyzing
      some security and safety issues in eHealth from the particular prospective of the
      identity management and standardization. The paper highlights the mission of the 
      EU funded "BioHealth" project whose mission is to increase the stakeholders'
      knowledge about existing and emerging standards in eHealth with particular
      reference to identity management.

TI  - OPTISAS a new method to analyse patients with Sleep Apnea Syndrome.
PG  - 547-52
AB  - OPTISAS is a visualization method that allows describing very precisely a patient
      with Sleep Apnea Syndrome. Using the events scored by the physician, our method
      gives a set of graphs that are a detailed representation of the condition, sleep 
      stage and position, in which the events occur. This helps for the diagnosis. This
      is possible thanks to the application of Generalized Caseview method. The method 
      proceeds in two steps, defining the reference frame and using this reference
      frame to visualize data. The reference frame is built by using a supin/unsupine
      binary criterion, a six type event criterion and a sleep stage ordinal criterion.
      The main result is the visualization of the indexes (average number of events by 
      hour) associated with the events. This allows a more accurate diagnosis showing
      the precise influence of the position and of the sleep stage on the events.

TI  - CEMARA: a Web dynamic application within a N-tier architecture for rare diseases.
PG  - 51-6
AB  - Rare diseases include a group of conditions characterized by a prevalence lower
      than 5 per 10,000 in the community. In France, any rare disease affects less than
      30,000 patients and often much less. Three to 4% of children and 6% of the
      population in Europe are affected. It is a true public health stake since most
      diseases do not have any curative treatment. In France, the Ministry of Health
      has initiated a National Rare Diseases Plan. Twenty five out of 132 labelled
      Reference Centres (RC) decided to share a common Information System named CEMARA.
      It is dedicated to collect continuous and complete records of all patients
      presenting with a rare disease, and their follow-up. The main objective of CEMARA
      is to contribute to the missions of the RC regarding the registration and
      description of their activities, coordination of the network of their
      correspondents, organization of the follow-up of rare diseases, and analysis of
      the epidemiological patterns. A description of CEMARA is provided as well as its 
      cooperation with Orphanet and Genatlas, and a presentation of 11803 current
      records collected by more than 300 health care professionals belonging to more
      than 70 sites.

TI  - The impact of co-morbidity on GPs' pharmacological treatment decisions for
      patients with an anxiety disorder.
PG  - 538-46
AB  - BACKGROUND: Co-morbidity may influence GPs' treatment decisions for patients with
      anxiety. However, knowledge about differences in the pharmacological treatment of
      anxiety disorders in patients with and without co-morbidity is lacking.
      OBJECTIVE: To compare GPs' pharmacological treatment patterns for anxiety in
      patients with and without co-morbidity. METHODS: Data were extracted from
      computerized medical records of 77 general practices participating in the Dutch
      National Information Network of General Practice (LINH). We used diagnosis and
      prescription data of patients, aged 18-65 years, with a newly diagnosed anxiety
      disorder (n=4604). A mixed model technique was used to determine if there was a
      difference in the pharmacological treatment of anxiety with and without
      co-morbidity. RESULTS: During the year after diagnosing anxiety, anxious patients
      who also suffered from chronic somatic morbidity or social problems were
      prescribed more benzodiazepines (effect size [ES]=0.44, 95% confidence interval
      [CI]=0.16-0.72 and ES=0.67, 95% CI=0.22-1.25, respectively) but no more
      antidepressants than patients with anxiety only. Compared to patients with a
      single diagnosis of anxiety, anxious patients who suffered simultaneously from
      other psychiatric conditions received twice as many antidepressant prescriptions 
      (ES=2.07, 95% CI=1.89-2.56) as well as twice as many benzodiazepine prescriptions
      (ES=1.98, 95% CI=1.84-2.60) during the year after diagnosing anxiety. For all
      subgroups, the prescription rate of benzodiazepines remained high throughout the 
      year after diagnosing anxiety. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that psychiatric 
      co-morbidity in anxious patients leads to higher prescription levels of both
      antidepressants and benzodiazepines. Chronic somatic co-morbidity and co-morbid
      social problems also lead to higher prescription levels of benzodiazepines, but
      does not seem to influence GPs' prescribing of antidepressants. The prescription 
      pattern of benzodiazepines was inconsistent with guideline recommendations.

TI  - Multimethod evaluation of information and communication technologies in health in
      the context of wicked problems and sociotechnical theory.
PG  - 746-55
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Few research designs look at the deep structure of complex social
      systems. We report the design and implementation of a multimethod evaluation
      model to assess the impact of computerized order entry systems on both the
      technical and social systems within a health care organization. DESIGN: We
      designed a multimethod evaluation model informed by sociotechnical theory and an 
      appreciation of the nature of wicked problems. We mobilized this model to assess 
      the impact of an electronic medication management system via a three-year program
      of research at a major academic hospital. MEASUREMENTS: Model components include 
      measurements relating to three dimensions of system impact: safety and quality,
      organizational culture, and work and communication patterns. RESULTS: Application
      of the evaluation model required the development and testing of purpose-built
      measurement tools such as software to collect multidimensional work measurement
      data. The model applied established research methods including medication error
      audits and social network analysis. Design features of these tools and techniques
      are described, along with the practical challenges of their implementation. The
      distinctiveness of doing research within a unique paradigm of complex systems,
      explicating the wickedness and the dimensionality of sociotechnical theory, is
      articulated. CONCLUSION: Designing an effective evaluation model requires a deep 
      understanding of the nature and complexity of the problems that information
      technology interventions in health care are trying to address. Adopting a
      sociotechnical perspective for model generation improves our ability to develop
      evaluation models that are adaptive and sensitive to the characteristics of
      wicked problems and provides a strong theoretical basis from which to analyze and
      interpret findings.

TI  - A security architecture for health information networks.
PG  - 379-83
AB  - Health information network security needs to balance exacting security controls
      with practicality, and ease of implementation in today's healthcare enterprise.
      Recent work on 'nationwide health information network' architectures has sought
      to share highly confidential data over insecure networks such as the Internet.
      Using basic patterns of health network data flow and trust models to support
      secure communication between network nodes, we abstract network security
      requirements to a core set to enable secure inter-network data sharing. We
      propose a minimum set of security controls that can be implemented without
      needing major new technologies, but yet realize network security and privacy
      goals of confidentiality, integrity and availability. This framework combines a
      set of technology mechanisms with environmental controls, and is shown to be
      sufficient to counter commonly encountered network security threats adequately.

AB  - Information and communication are two components, influencing decisional and
      management activity in the Health Institutions. Information is retrieved,
      processed and diffused in any organization level, improving knowledge in the
      health and technical-administrative departments. In communication networks data
      flow from a "source" to different environments and structures requiring
      information, passing through "decisional points", called "nodes". The
      responsibility of the entire system is devoted to the process of the information 
      in itself. Principal databases, allowed by actual technology information systems,
      used in a teaching hospital, thanks to the experience of our Azienda
      Ospedaliero-Universitaria in Ferrara, are described in this work. Several kinds
      of sources, processes and uses of data will be focused, including a description
      of the improving architecture of the "network" of our teaching hospital and its
      integration with our Regional and National Health Service.

TI  - An informatics approach to assess pediatric pharmacotherapy: design and
      implementation of a hospital drug utilization system.
PG  - 1172-80
AB  - Drug utilization in the inpatient setting can provide a mechanism to assess drug 
      prescribing trends, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness of hospital formularies
      and examine subpopulations for which prescribing habits may be different. Such
      data can be used to correlate trends with time-dependent or seasonal changes in
      clinical event rates or the introduction of new pharmaceuticals. It is now
      possible to provide a robust, dynamic analysis of drug utilization in a large
      pediatric inpatient setting through the creation of a Web-based hospital drug
      utilization system that retrieves source data from our accounting database. The
      production implementation provides a dynamic and historical account of drug
      utilization at the authors' institution. The existing application can easily be
      extended to accommodate a multi-institution environment. The creation of a
      national or even global drug utilization network would facilitate the examination
      of geographical and/or socioeconomic influences in drug utilization and
      prescribing practices in general.

      technology.
PG  - 260-5
AB  - Wireless cellular broadband technology currently transmits data at speeds that
      only wired broadband connections were capable of until now. By using high-speed
      data access protocols such as evolution data optimized (EV-DO) or enhanced data
      rate for global system for mobile communications evolution (EDGE), gaining access
      to patient data in an orthodontic office remotely has become a relatively simple 
      task. Affordable and convenient cellular broadband networks allow the
      orthodontist to remotely access schedules, and update, review, add, or modify
      data virtually from anywhere. Newer generation wireless broadband technologies
      have made the virtual office a reality. This article discusses the various
      broadband technologies that are available for the orthodontist as a techno-savvy 
      consumer and the availability of wide area networks that include third-generation
      cellular technologies that can be used for remote access of patient data. The new
      enterprise-level gadgets that use third-generation technologies are also
      introduced.

TI  - Do initial radiographs agree with crash site mechanism of injury in pelvic ring
      disruptions? A pilot study.
PG  - 375-80
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Direction of injury force inferred from pelvic radiographs may be used
      in trauma care to predict associated injuries and guide intervention. Our
      objective was to compare injury direction determined from anteroposterior (AP)
      pelvic radiographs with injury forces determined from crash site investigation.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied all 28 subjects from the Crash Injury Research 
      Engineering Network (CIREN) database who met inclusion criteria of pelvic ring
      disruption, single-event crash, restrained front-seat occupant,
      diagnostic-quality pelvic radiography, and complete crash investigation data.
      Assessment of diagnostic quality of pelvic radiography was made by 2 radiologists
      who were blinded to all other subject information. Crash site investigation data 
      included principal direction of force (PDOF), crash magnitude, and passenger
      compartment intrusion. An orthopedic trauma surgeon and a fellowship-trained
      emergency radiologist independently assessed the pelvic radiographs to determine 
      the injury PDOF and the Young-Burgess and Tile fracture classifications, with
      disputes resolved by an additional emergency radiologist. Agreement between
      injury forces and pelvic radiographs was assessed using the kappa statistic.
      RESULTS: The PDOF was anterior in 9 (32%) and lateral in 19 (68%) subjects. The
      readers agreed with the crash primary direction of force in 21 (75%) subjects
      (kappa=0.42). In subjects with lateral PDOF, agreement was 89% (17/19) compared
      to 44% for anterior PDOF (4/9). Interobserver agreement for the Young and Tile
      classification schemes was moderate (weighted kappa 0.44 and 0.54, respectively).
      CONCLUSION: Crash site investigation and pelvic radiography may provide
      conflicting information about primary direction of injuring forces. Presumed
      anterior impact based on PDOF is not in consistent agreement with the pattern of 
      injury evident on the AP pelvic radiograph.

TI  - Creating a GIS application for health services at Jeddah city.
PG  - 879-89
AB  - This paper explores the possibilities of using GIS for private hospitals at
      Jeddah city, Saudi Arabia. A GIS application is created to cover three main
      health planning issues which are distribution of health demand, classification of
      hospital patients and the definition of hospital service area. Each one of these 
      issues is covered using several GIS functions including network analysis and
      overlay analysis. The former is used to produce drive-time hospital service area 
      and the latter is applied at the selected hospital to calculate the size of its
      served demand. GIS has several useful functions and tools that can be used in
      health planning field. This paper uses some of these functions for one private
      hospital. These functions are used to help health planners on evaluating the
      spatial distribution of hospital demand and for defining hospital service area.
      All the produced models can be applied on any private or public hospital in
      Jeddah city. They can be used to build a spatial decision support system for
      hospitals in Jeddah city.

TI  - The information requirements and information-seeking behaviours of health and
      social care professionals providing care to children with health care needs: a
      pilot study.
PG  - 95-102
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this work were to identify the sources of
      information currently received, information-seeking behaviours, information
      requirements and preferences for future information provision amongst health and 
      social care professionals providing care to children with health care needs.
      METHODS: Data were collected using a cross-sectional postal questionnaire survey.
      RESULTS: A wide range of information resources was reported as being available to
      professionals. However, a large proportion of respondents found it necessary to
      perform additional searches for information, suggesting that current resources
      were not satisfying their needs. The majority of professionals reported a
      preference for electronic formats, whilst a smaller proportion preferred hard
      copy materials. Participants promoted the use of informal networks as a means of 
      support and exchange of information. CONCLUSION: Supplementing the information
      that is provided in electronic and hard copy formats, by enhancing informal
      networks, may be the most effective way of meeting the information needs of this 
      group of professionals.

TI  - A cost-effective add-on-value card-assisted firewall over Taiwan's NHI VPN
      framework.
PG  - 103-16
AB  - Besides the overall budget for building the infrastructure of a
      healthcare-service-based virtual private network (VPN) in Taiwan, two issues were
      considered critical for its acceptance by the country's 17,000 plus medical
      institutions. One was who was to pay for the network (ADSL or modem) connection
      fee; the other was who was to pay for the firewall/anti-virus software. This
      paper addresses the second issue by proposing an efficient freeware firewall,
      named card-assisted firewall (CAF), for NHI VPN edge-hosts, which is also an
      add-on-value application of the National Healthcare IC card that every insurant
      and medical professional has. The innovative concept is that any NHI VPN site
      (edge-host) can establish diversified secure-authenticated connections with other
      sites only by an authentication mechanism, which requires a NHI Java card state
      machine and the Access Control List of the host. It is different from two-factor 
      authentication cards in four ways: (1) a PIN code is not a must; (2) it requires 
      authentication with the remote IC card Data Centre; (3) the NHI cards are already
      available, no modification is needed, and there is no further cost for the
      deployment of the cards; (4) although the cards are in the reader, the
      communication cannot start unless the cards are in the corresponding states; i.e.
      the states allow communication. An implementation, on a Microsoft Windows XP
      platform, demonstrated the system's feasibility over an emulation of the NHI VPN 
      framework. It maintained a high line speed, the driver took up 39 KB of disk
      space, installation was simple, not requiring any extra hardware or software, and
      the average packet processing time of the CAF driver measured was 0.3084 ms. The 
      average overhead in comparing the Access Control List predefined routing in card,
      in an FTP testing experiment, was 5.7 micros (receiving) and 8 micros (sending).

TI  - A longitudinal social network analysis of the editorial boards of medical
      informatics and bioinformatics journals.
PG  - 340-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The goal of this research is to learn how the editorial staffs of
      bioinformatics and medical informatics journals provide support for
      cross-community exposure. Models such as co-citation and co-author analysis
      measure the relationships between researchers; but they do not capture how
      environments that support knowledge transfer across communities are organized.
      METHODS: In this paper, we propose a social network analysis model to study how
      editorial boards integrate researchers from disparate communities. We evaluate
      our model by building relational networks based on the editorial boards of
      approximately 40 journals that serve as research outlets in medical informatics
      and bioinformatics. We track the evolution of editorial relationships through a
      longitudinal investigation over the years 2000 through 2005. RESULTS: Our
      findings suggest that there are research journals that support the collocation of
      editorial board members from the bioinformatics and medical informatics
      communities. Network centrality metrics indicate that editorial board members are
      located in the intersection of the communities and that the number of individuals
      in the intersection is growing with time. CONCLUSIONS: Social network analysis
      methods provide insight into the relationships between the medical informatics
      and bioinformatics communities. The number of editorial board members
      facilitating the publication intersection of the communities has grown, but the
      intersection remains dependent on a small group of individuals and fragile.

TI  - A population-based comparison of CIREN and NASS cases using similarity scoring.
PG  - 395-417
AB  - The Crash Injury Research and Engineering Network (CIREN) provides significant
      details on injuries, and data on patient outcomes that is unavailable in the
      National Automotive Sampling System (NASS). However, CIREN cases are selected
      from specific Level I trauma centers with different inclusion criteria than those
      used for NASS, and the assertion that a given case is similar to the population
      of NASS cases is often made qualitatively. A robust, quantitative method is
      needed to compare CIREN to weighted NASS populations. This would greatly improve 
      the usefulness and applicability of research conducted with data from the CIREN
      database. Our objective is to outline and demonstrate the utility of such a
      system to compare CIREN and NASS cases. This study applies the Mahalanobis
      distance metric methodology to determine similarity between CIREN and NASS/CDS
      cases. The Mahalanobis distance method is a multivariate technique for population
      comparison. Independent variables considered were total delta V, age, weight,
      height, maximum AIS, ISS, model year, gender, maximum intrusion, number of lower 
      and upper extremity injuries, and number of head and chest injuries. The
      technique provides a unit-independent quantitative score which can be used to
      identify similarity of CIREN and NASS cases. Weighted NASS data and CIREN data
      were obtained for the years 2001-2005. NASS cases with Maximum AIS 3 resulted in 
      a subset of 1,869 NASS cases, and 2,819 CIREN cases.

TI  - Evaluation of shared EHR services in primary healthcare centers and their rural
      community offices: the twister story.
PG  - 6422-5
AB  - Ten years after primary, secondary, and tertiary healthcare facilities in Crete
      were connected in HYGEIAnet, one of the first regional health information
      networks worldwide, the Twister project addressed the practical challenge of
      delivering integrated eHealth services to remote healthcare facilities in Crete
      and the south Aegean. A hybrid network infrastructure comprising terrestrial
      broadband, wireless, and satellite segments provided connectivity among
      distributed healthcare organizations. A fast-track methodology of continuous
      training and evaluation was used to encourage the wide adoption of EHR services
      in primary healthcare centers and their remote community offices, eTraining in
      prehospital emergency management, and medical collaboration. For the evaluation
      of Twister, health professionals using EHRs and citizens visiting the healthcare 
      facilities provided their attitudes and perceptions on eHealth. Although eHealth 
      is viewed differently by citizens and health professionals, both groups consider 
      the EHR as an important part of the daily medical practice. However, continuous
      training, practical incentives, and awareness initiatives are necessary to
      increase the use of EHRs and the social embedding of eHealth in rural areas.

TI  - Bayesian confidence propagation neural network.
PG  - 623-5
AB  - A Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN)-based technique has been
      in routine use for data mining the 3 million suspected adverse drug reactions
      (ADRs) in the WHO database of suspected ADRs of as part of the signal-detection
      process since 1998. Data mining is used to enhance the early detection of
      previously unknown possible drug-ADR relationships, by highlighting combinations 
      that stand out quantitatively for clinical review. Now-established signals
      prospectively detected from routine data mining include topiramate associated
      glaucoma, and the SSRIs with neonatal withdrawal syndrome. Recent advances in the
      method and its use will be discussed: (i) the recurrent neural network approach
      used to analyse cyclo-oxygenase 2 inhibitor data, isolating patterns for both
      rofecoxib and celecoxib; (ii) the use of data-mining methods to improve data
      quality, especially the detection of duplicate reports; and (iii) the application
      of BCPNN to the 2 million patient-record IMS Disease Analyzer.

TI  - The Internet and healthcare in Taiwan: value-added applications on the medical
      network in the National Health Insurance smart card system.
PG  - 417-32
AB  - The introduction of smart card technology has ushered in a new era of electronic 
      medical information systems. Taiwan's Bureau of National Health Insurance (BNHI) 
      implemented the National Health Insurance (NHI) smart card project in 2004. The
      purpose of the project was to replace all paper cards with one smart card. The
      NHI medical network now provides three kinds of services. In this paper, we
      illustrate the status of the NHI smart card system in Taiwan and propose three
      kinds of value-added applications for the medical network, which are electronic
      exchange of medical information, retrieval of personal medical records and
      medical e-learning for future development of health information systems.

TI  - The medication advice-seeking network of staff in an Australian hospital renal
      ward.
PG  - 217-31
AB  - Electronic medication systems may impact communication in hospital wards. To
      identify the ways in which communication patterns may be altered it is necessary 
      to compare processes both before and after system introduction. This paper
      reports the use of a social network approach to examine the medication
      advice-seeking network of an Australian hospital renal ward before the
      introduction of an electronic medication management system. A social network
      questionnaire was completed by 96% of staff members (doctors, nurses, allied
      health professionals and administrative staff) on the ward (n=45). Survey data
      were analysed to produce a sociogram to display the medication advice-seeking
      network of the staff in the ward. The results showed that there was a relatively 
      low level of advice-seeking about medication-related decisions and tasks. Most
      communication occurred within professional groups. Several key individuals were
      pivotal in providing advice both within and across professional groups.

TI  - Are problem-oriented medial records (POMR) suitable for use in GPs' daily
      practice?
PG  - 68-72
AB  - Problem-oriented functions have been implemented in almost all Belgian GPs'
      software systems since 2003. We therefore investigated whether some of them -
      especially the explicit linking procedure between treatments or referrals and the
      relevant problems - can be used by GPs in their current daily practice. In 2005, 
      within the Belgian ResoPrim project, we organized data collection, mainly around 
      the theme of "hypertension and cardiovascular risk factors", by 26 volunteer GPs'
      practices using three different software systems. Data were collected
      prospectively over six weeks in early 2005, and retrospectively for 2004. In this
      paper we report only on the part of the study that aimed to assess the linking
      procedure. For all patients and hypertensive patients alike, the key indicators
      used were the percentage of (problem-) linked drugs among the drugs extracted,
      the percentage of anti-hypertensive (problem-) linked drugs among
      anti-hypertensive drugs extracted, and the percentage of (problem-) linked
      referrals among the number of referrals extracted. For all patients, the data
      collected relate to 10,914 contacts (7,831 patients) in 2005, and to 74,878
      contacts (16,813 patients) in 2004. Large variations were observed per software
      system and GP, and also over time. The percentage of linked drugs rose from 2%
      (2004, two GPs) to 36% (2005, fourteen GPs). For linked referrals the percentage 
      was 65% in 2004 vs. 75% in 2005. Our study shows that some functions related to
      the problem-oriented patient record were spontaneously used by GPs in daily
      practice. This use increased during collaboration with the primary care research 
      network. This increase was not restricted to the theme of data collection (i.e.
      not restricted to hypertensive patients, to anti-hypertensive drugs or to links
      with cardiovascular problems).

AB  - This national study examines the impact of the Antihypertensive and
      Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) on the
      prescribing of thiazide-type diuretics and other antihypertensive medications for
      patients with newly diagnosed hypertension. A cross-sectional analysis was
      conducted using data from a national network of electronic health records for 2
      groups with newly diagnosed hypertension and started on antihypertensive
      medications: one a year before and the other a year after the publication of
      ALLHAT. The percentage of new hypertensives started on thiazides increased from
      29% pre-ALLHAT to 39% post-ALLHAT. An increase was also seen for angiotensin
      receptor blockers, while prescribing for angiotensin-converting enzyme
      inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, and beta-blockers declined. There was no
      significant change in prescriptions for alpha-blockers. Prescriptions for
      thiazides for patients with newly diagnosed hypertension increased after the
      publication of ALLHAT. Data from large national trials can have a considerable
      impact on prescribing practices.

PG  - 2825-34
AB  - Even though the causes of suicide may be rooted in childhood, it is unknown how
      socioeconomic position (SEP) in childhood is related to suicide in adulthood. We 
      describe the association between childhood SEP and suicide mortality in adulthood
      in Norway using registry data on 613807 Norwegians born in 1955-1965. Data on
      1013 suicide deaths between 1990 and 2001 were linked to data on SEP indicators, 
      using Cox regression. Suicide mortality was higher among women with high
      childhood SEP than among women with low childhood SEP. This association was
      explained in part by family situation in adulthood, but not by adult SEP. For
      males, after adjustment for adult SEP, we observed a similar but weaker
      association between suicide and childhood SEP. We discuss several mechanisms
      which may explain the direct positive association of childhood SEP with suicide
      mortality in adulthood, especially among females. These are downward mobility,
      not meeting high demands set by highly educated parents, psychological distress, 
      mental disorder, gender differences and social networks and norms.

TI  - Ethnicity coding in a regional cancer registry and in Hospital Episode
      Statistics.
PG  - 281
AB  - BACKGROUND: The collection of ethnicity information as part of cancer datasets is
      important for planning services and ensuring equal access, and for
      epidemiological studies. However, ethnicity has generally not been well recorded 
      in cancer registries in the UK. The aim of this study was to determine the
      completeness of ethnicity coding in the Thames Cancer Registry (TCR) database and
      within the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data as held by the London Health
      Observatory, and to investigate factors associated with ethnicity being recorded.
      METHODS: Records for 111821 hospital admissions of London residents with a
      malignant cancer as a primary diagnosis between April 2002 and March 2003 and
      records for 25581 London residents diagnosed with cancer in 2002 were examined.
      Data on sex, age, cancer network of residence, deprivation, proportion of
      non-whites in the local authority population, and site of cancer were available. 
      The proportion of patients in each group with a valid ethnicity code was
      calculated. In the TCR data proportions were also calculated adjusted for all
      other variables. RESULTS: Ethnicity was recorded for 90661 (81.1%) of the
      hospital admissions in the HES data and 5796 (22.7%) patients on the TCR
      database. Patients resident in areas with a higher proportion of non-white
      residents and the most deprived populations were more likely to have an ethnic
      code on the TCR database, though this pattern was not seen in the HES data.
      Adjustment did not materially affect the association between deprivation and
      ethnicity being recorded in the TCR data. CONCLUSION: There was a large
      difference in completeness of ethnicity between the data sources. In order to
      improve the level of recording in TCR data there needs to be better recording of 
      ethnicity in sources TCR data collection staff have access to, or use of
      information from other sources e.g. electronic data feeds from hospitals or
      pathology laboratories, or HES data itself supplied directly to TCR. Efforts to
      collect ethnicity data should be encouraged in all healthcare settings. Future
      research should explore where the difficulties collecting ethnicity information
      lie, whether with patients, healthcare professionals or the recording procedure, 
      and how such problems can be overcome.

TI  - Factors influencing pediatric Injury Severity Score and Glasgow Coma Scale in
      pediatric automobile crashes: results from the Crash Injury Research Engineering 
      Network.
PG  - 1854-8
AB  - BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Motor vehicle crashes account for more than 50% of pediatric 
      injuries. Triage of pediatric patients to appropriate centers can be based on the
      crash/injury characteristics. Pediatric motor vehicle crash/injury
      characteristics can be determined from an in vitro laboratory using child crash
      dummies. However, to date, no detailed data with respect to outcomes and crash
      mechanism have been presented with a pediatric in vivo model. METHODS: The Crash 
      Injury Research Engineering Network is comprised of 10 level 1 trauma centers.
      Crashes were examined with regard to age, crash severity (DeltaV), crash
      direction, restraint use, and airbag deployment. Multiple logistic regression
      analysis was performed with Injury Severity Score (ISS) and Glasgow Coma Scale
      (GCS) as outcomes. Standard age groupings (0-4, 5-9, 10-14, and 15-18) were used.
      The database is biases toward a survivor population with few fatalities. RESULTS:
      Four hundred sixty-one motor vehicle crashes with 2500 injuries were analyzed
      (242 boys, 219 girls). Irrespective of age, DeltaV > 30 mph resulted in increased
      ISS and decreased GCS (eg, for 0-4 years, DeltaV < 30: ISS = 10, GCS = 13.5 vs
      DeltaV > 30: ISS = 19.5, GCS = 10.6; P < .007, < .002, respectively). Controlling
      for DeltaV, children in lateral crashes had increased ISS and decreased GCS
      versus those in frontal crashes. Airbag deployment was protective for children 15
      to 18 years old and resulted in a lower ISS and higher GCS (odds ratio, 2.1; 95% 
      confidence interval, 0.9-4.6). Front-seat passengers suffered more severe (ISS > 
      15) injuries than did backseat passengers (odds ratio, 1.7; 95% confidence
      interval, 0.7-3.4). A trend was noted for children younger than 12 years sitting 
      in the front seat to have increased ISS and decreased GCS with airbag deployment 
      but was limited by case number. CONCLUSION: A reproducible pattern of increased
      ISS and lower GCS characterized by high severity, lateral crashes in children was
      noted. Further analysis of the specific injuries as a function and the crash
      characteristic can help guide management and prevention strategies.

TI  - Electronic healthcare communications in Vietnam in 2004.
PG  - 764-70
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a lack of literature about health information systems (HIS) 
      in "developing" countries, including Vietnam. However, computerization and
      network development are proceeding in these places, although not in a systematic,
      transparent way. OBJECTIVE: This is a preliminary overview of HIS's and
      healthcare communications in Vietnam's four-tiered public healthcare system. It
      is to indicate the direction that nation might take in order to establish a
      modern, standards-compliant, national HIS. METHODS: We conducted site visits and 
      interviews in Hanoi and nearby provinces. Additional information was derived from
      publications of the Vietnamese government and the United Nations. RESULTS: Many
      of the top-level "central" hospitals have HIS's, although their quality and daily
      usage varies. Fewer provincial hospitals have networks; district hospitals have a
      few stand-alone computers, and commune health centers have no computers. Patients
      often go directly to higher-level providers, due to a widely held perception of
      better care at such sites. Communications among healthcare units are largely on
      paper, consisting mostly of administrative matters and some hand-written patient 
      referrals. Telephones are used for discussions of specific matters. Internet
      connections are almost all dial-up and often belong to individual staff members
      rather than the healthcare units. Lower-level units derive much of their general 
      medical information from television and newspapers. However, there is
      considerable interest in computerization among healthcare workers at all levels. 
      CONCLUSION: Familiarization with computerized communications, i.e., training and 
      hardware at all healthcare levels, must be the first step towards a modern
      healthcare communications network in Vietnam. The skills to do this already
      exist. The aim of such a network must be to raise the level of information and
      quality of care at the lower levels. Adherence to international standards, such
      as HL7, from the beginning would enable the country to bypass many years of
      haphazard development.

TI  - The feasibility of implementing an electronic prescribing decision support
      system: a case study of an Australian public hospital.
PG  - 380-8
AB  - Medication errors are common in public hospitals, with the majority at the
      prescribing stage of the medication pathway. Electronic prescribing decision
      support (EPDS) is a rules-based computer system that can be used by clinicians to
      warn against such errors to improve patient safety and support staff workflows.
      Despite its apparent advantages, this technology has not been widely adopted in
      Australian public hospitals for inpatient prescribing. A case study using Sauer's
      (1993) Triangle of Dependencies Model was conducted in 2003 into the feasibility 
      of implementing an EPDS system at an Australian public hospital in New South
      Wales. It was found not feasible to implement an EPDS at the hospital studied due
      to the legacy patient administration system, low availability of information
      technology on the wards, differing stakeholder views, legislation, and the
      Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal of NSW report recommendations. A
      statewide standard was preferred, with an agreed specification framework
      identifying basic core data items and functions that an EPDS must meet which can 
      then be used by area health services to: (i) choose a solution which best meets
      their contextual needs; and (ii) engage vendors to tender for building an open
      source (non-proprietary) system based on the specification framework.

TI  - Recipient age and risk of chronic allograft nephropathy in primary deceased donor
      kidney transplant.
PG  - 649-56
AB  - Single center and registry data studies have had conflicting results regarding
      the impact of recipient age on chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN). We tested the
      hypothesis that advanced recipient age is a risk factor for graft failure due to 
      CAN. All patients who underwent primary deceased donor kidney transplant between 
      January 1, 1995 and December 31, 2000 recorded in the United Network of Organ
      Sharing (UNOS) database were analyzed for the occurrence of death censored graft 
      loss and by two different definitions of graft loss due to CAN. Kaplan-Meier
      analysis based on the recipient age, and Cox proportional hazard regression was
      used to estimate the independent effect of recipient age on the three endpoints
      of interest. For all endpoints, after age of 9 years, the risk of graft loss
      declined with each successive decade increase in age. This pattern of risk was
      similar for both Caucasian and African-American recipients, although for any
      given age the risk of graft loss was always higher in African-American
      recipients. Analysis of UNOS data does not support the hypothesis that advanced
      recipient age is a risk factor for CAN.

AB  - In the article,a plan of network construction which satisfies the demand of
      applications for a telemedical information sharing platform is proposed. We
      choice network access plans in view of user actual situation, through the
      analysis of the service demand and many kinds of network access technologies.
      Hospital servers that locate in LAN link sharing platform with node servers,
      should separate from the broadband network of sharing platform in order to ensure
      the security of the internal hospital network and the administration management. 
      We use the VPN technology to realize the safe transmission of information in the 
      platform network. Preliminary experiments have proved the plan is practicable.

      for neuropathic images, and discusses its significance and data sharing. The
      database is composed of three data volumes about basic knowledge for images,
      cranial sectional anatomy and neuropathic images. The data sharing is achieved by
      using a method of linking the dynamic network of neuropathic images with database
      of neuropathic images. There are three searching approaches: catalog searching,
      key words searching and code searching.

TI  - Flexible information storage in MUDR(II) EHR.
PG  - 201-8
AB  - An important research task of the EuroMISE Centre is the applied research in the 
      field of electronic health record (EHR) design including electronic medical
      guidelines and intelligent systems for data mining and decision support. The
      research in this field was inspired by several European projects. We have
      proposed a mathematical meta-description of a flexible information storage model 
      based on the experience gathered in cooperation in those projects. In this model,
      we use two basic structures called a knowledge base and data files. We describe
      those two structures using the graph theory concepts. Furthermore, we use logical
      formulas to express conditions that should be valid. Additionally, we present a
      description of a global system architecture of a 3-tier EHR application with
      interfaces based on the latest technologies; predominately on Web Services, SOAP,
      XML, HTTP, CORBA, etc. According to our experience and test results gained from
      the MUDR EHR usage, we describe an open universal solution, which can be applied 
      as the EHR kernel of hospital information systems. To realize this approach in a 
      daily practice for health professionals we have started a co-operative project
      with clinical information systems developers. Within that project we are
      developing a new system for continual shared health care.

TI  - Implementation of an intervention plan designed to optimize donor referral in a
      donor hospital network.
PG  - 46-51
AB  - CONTEXT: The shortage of donor organs remains the most important factor of
      waiting list mortality in organ transplantation worldwide. Donor detection is
      influenced by the legal system, family refusal, and underreporting caused by
      erroneous knowledge of donation criteria and lack of familiarity with the
      procedure. OBJECTIVE: To identify possible key factors of donor referral patterns
      within an existing cooperation with donor hospitals and donor units across the
      Dutch-speaking part of Belgium, an area of approximately 3 million inhabitants.
      An intervention plan to optimize the cooperation and procedure quality and
      efficiency was designed. DESIGN: The intervention plan was based on 3 essential
      principles in donor referral by donor reporters, information on donor criteria,
      facilitation of the donor procedure, and communication between donor reporters
      and the transplant center. The interventions were structured to optimize all 3 of
      these principles. Two successive periods of 4 years were retrospectively
      compared. PARTICIPANTS: Data were collected retrospectively on donor referral
      behavior from a total of 37 donor hospitals and donor units over an 8-year
      period. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The referrals were reviewed for potential donors, 
      effective donors, percentage of effective donors, refusal rate of relatives,
      number of tissue donors, impact on local and national transplant programs, and
      national donor numbers. RESULTS: Data showed a significant positive impact on
      donor referrals and donor referral behavior (+27% potential donors, +30%
      effective donors, +172.7% tissue donors, -7% family refusals rates, +9.63%
      national donors). The results stress the importance of reduced workload and
      optimization of communication and information availability in an existing donor
      hospital network.

TI  - Patterns of severe injury in pediatric car crash victims: Crash Injury Research
      Engineering Network database.
PG  - 362-7
AB  - BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Motor vehicle crashes (MVCs) account for 50% of pediatric
      trauma. Safety improvements are typically tested with child crash dummies using
      an in vitro model. The Crash Injury Research Engineering Network (CIREN) provides
      an in vivo validation process. Previous research suggest that children in lateral
      crashes or front-seat locations have higher Injury Severity Scale scores and
      lower Glasgow Coma Scale scores than those in frontal-impact crashes. However,
      specific injury patterns and crash characteristics have not been characterized.
      METHODS: Data were collected from the CIREN multidisciplinary crash
      reconstruction network (10 pediatric trauma centers). Injuries were examined with
      regard to crash direction (frontal/lateral), restraint use, seat location, and
      change in velocity at impact (DeltaV). Injuries were limited to Abbreviated
      Injury Scale (AIS) scores of 3 or higher and included head, thoracic, abdominal, 
      pelvic, spine, and long bone (orthopedic) injuries. Standard age groupings (0-4, 
      5-9, 10-14, and 15-18 years) were used. Statistical analyses used Fisher's Exact 
      test and multiple logistic regressions. RESULTS: Four hundred seventeen MVCs with
      2500 injuries were analyzed (males = 219, females = 198). Controlling for DeltaV 
      and age, children in lateral-impact crashes (n = 232) were significantly more
      likely to suffer severe injuries to the head and thorax as compared with children
      in frontal crashes (n = 185), who were more likely to suffer severe spine and
      orthopedic injuries. Children in a front-seat (n = 236) vs those in a back-seat
      (n = 169) position had more injuries to the thoracic (27% vs 17%), abdominal (21%
      vs 13%), pelvic (11% vs 1%), and orthopedic (28% vs 10%) regions (P < .05 for
      all). Seat belts were protective for pelvic (5% vs 12% unbelted) and orthopedic
      (15% vs 40%) injuries (odds ratio = 3, P < .01 for both). CONCLUSION: A
      reproducible pattern of injury is noted for children involved in lateral-impact
      crashes characterized by head and chest injuries. The Injury Severity Scale
      scores were higher for children in front-seat positions. Increased lateral-impact
      safety measures such as mandatory side curtain airbags may decrease morbidity.
      Furthermore, continued public education for positioning children in the back seat
      of cars is warranted.

TI  - Design and implementation of a smart card based healthcare information system.
PG  - 66-78
AB  - Smart cards are used in information technologies as portable integrated devices
      with data storage and data processing capabilities. As in other fields, smart
      card use in health systems became popular due to their increased capacity and
      performance. Their efficient use with easy and fast data access facilities leads 
      to implementation particularly widespread in security systems. In this paper, a
      smart card based healthcare information system is developed. The system uses
      smart card for personal identification and transfer of health data and provides
      data communication via a distributed protocol which is particularly developed for
      this study. Two smart card software modules are implemented that run on patient
      and healthcare professional smart cards, respectively. In addition to personal
      information, general health information about the patient is also loaded to
      patient smart card. Health care providers use their own smart cards to be
      authenticated on the system and to access data on patient cards. Encryption keys 
      and digital signature keys stored on smart cards of the system are used for
      secure and authenticated data communication between clients and database servers 
      over distributed object protocol. System is developed on Java platform by using
      object oriented architecture and design patterns.

PG  - 5214-7
AB  - Mobile health care solutions involving patient monitoring are an increasingly
      accepted element in chronic disease management strategies. When used in
      healthcare systems with different providers, it is essential that the information
      gathered from the patient is available at each of these providers information
      repositories. This paper describes the design of a connectivity interface based
      on the HL7 standard that allows the MOTOHEALTH mobile health care solution to
      communicate with external electronic healthcare record systems supporting HL7.

TI  - Standards for medical device communication: X73 PoC-MDC.
PG  - 242-56
AB  - When using a number of medical devices from very different manufacturers with
      different proprietary formats the problem of a lack of interoperability emerges. 
      Connectivity and communications are then limited and the systems and users can
      not exploit all the possibilities that Information and Communication Technologies
      offer today. The use and application of standards can be the solution to bring
      light to this confusion of languages in this Tower of Babel. There are several
      standards applicable to medical information systems interoperability and,
      analyzing these different options, the X73 PoC-MDC (ISO11073/IEEE1073) set of
      standards for Point of Care Medical Device Communication is the best positioned
      international standard to provide interoperability in these communications.

TI  - New trends in the virtualization of hospitals--tools for global e-Health.
PG  - 168-75
AB  - The development of virtual hospitals and digital medicine helps to bridge the
      digital divide between different regions of the world and enables equal access to
      high-level medical care. Pre-operative planning, intra-operative navigation and
      minimally-invasive surgery require a digital and virtual environment supporting
      the perception of the physician. As data and computing resources in a virtual
      hospital are distributed over many sites the concept of the Grid should be
      integrated with other communication networks and platforms. A promising approach 
      is the implementation of service-oriented architectures for an invisible grid,
      hiding complexity for both application developers and end-users. Examples of
      promising medical applications of Grid technology are the real-time
      3D-visualization and manipulation of patient data for individualized treatment
      planning and the creation of distributed intelligent databases of medical images.

TI  - [Computer-based system for monitoring the course of intraocular inflammation].
PG  - 1069-73
AB  - BACKGROUND: Until now, there has been no consistent rating system for changes of 
      intraocular inflammation. We present such a computer-based system. METHODS: This 
      program is based on a FileMaker database. It is made of anterior and posterior
      uveitis scores on the basis of published evaluation guidelines of the
      International Ocular Inflammation Society (IOIS). An anterior uveitis score
      consisting of anterior chamber cells, flare, and perilimbal injection on the one 
      hand and a posterior uveitis score consisting of vitreous haze, macula, and optic
      nerve head edema on the other hand are calculated. After adding visual acuity,
      intraocular pressure, and systemic dose of corticosteroids, all parameters can be
      visualized by a radar graph. RESULTS: This system of documentation is easy to
      handle and presents a simplified version of the disease course. The abstract
      visualization enables the patient to better understand the therapeutic
      management. CONCLUSIONS: The program presented here offers good opportunities for
      standardized monitoring of the disease course.

TI  - Error detection in anatomic pathology.
PG  - 1237-45
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To define the magnitude of error occurring in anatomic pathology, to 
      propose a scheme to classify such errors so their influence on clinical outcomes 
      can be evaluated, and to identify quality assurance procedures able to reduce the
      frequency of errors. DESIGN: (a) Peer-reviewed literature search via PubMed for
      studies from single institutions and multi-institutional College of American
      Pathologists Q-Probes studies of anatomic pathology error detection and
      prevention practices; (b) structured evaluation of defects in surgical pathology 
      reports uncovered in the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine of the
      Henry Ford Health System in 2001-2003, using a newly validated error taxonomy
      scheme; and (c) comparative review of anatomic pathology quality assurance
      procedures proposed to reduce error. RESULTS: Marked differences in both
      definitions of error and pathology practice make comparison of error detection
      and prevention procedures among publications from individual institutions
      impossible. Q-Probes studies further suggest that observer redundancy reduces
      diagnostic variation and interpretive error, which ranges from 1.2 to 50 errors
      per 1000 cases; however, it is unclear which forms of such redundancy are the
      most efficient in uncovering diagnostic error. The proposed error taxonomy tested
      has shown a very good interobserver agreement of 91.4% (kappa = 0.8780; 95%
      confidence limit, 0.8416-0.9144), when applied to amended reports, and suggests a
      distribution of errors among identification, specimen, interpretation, and
      reporting variables. CONCLUSIONS: Presently, there are no standardized tools for 
      defining error in anatomic pathology, so it cannot be reliably measured nor can
      its clinical impact be assessed. The authors propose a standardized error
      classification that would permit measurement of error frequencies, clinical
      impact of errors, and the effect of error reduction and prevention efforts. In
      particular, the value of double-reading, case conferences, and consultations (the
      traditional triad of error control in anatomic pathology) awaits objective
      assessment.

TI  - [Professional health cards (CPS): informatic health care system in France].
PG  - 350-5
AB  - The Professional Health Card Public interest group (Groupement d'Interet
      Public-Carte de professionnel de Sante (GIP-CPS)) was founded in 1993 as a joint 
      initiative by the different parties involved in health care in France: the state,
      the representatives of the health care professions and the compulsory and
      complementary health insurance organizations. The CPS system enables safe
      exchange and electronic sharing of medical data. Via Intranet connections and
      Extranet hosting of medical files, databases, the CPS system enables health care 
      professionals who access servers to be identified with certainty. For email
      exhanges, the CPS systems guarantees the sender's identity and capacity. The
      electronic signature gives legal value to the email. The system also enables
      confidential email. The health card system (CPS) contributes to making the health
      service efficient. Shared medical files, health care networks, health warning
      systems or electronic requests for reimbursement of health insurance expenses all
      use the CPS system. More than 300,000 health care professionals use it regularly.
      The freedom of movement of patients throughout Europe has led to the growth of
      exchanges and information sharing between health professionals in the States of
      the Union. More and more health professionals will be leaving their own countries
      to work in foreign countries in the future. It is essential that their freedom of
      movement is accompanied by the ability to prove their rights to practice.

TI  - [Patients' mailbox and electronic prescription].
PG  - 732-5
AB  - Electronic prescribing shall contribute essentially to improved healthcare
      services from 2006 onwards in Germany. The desired improvements, however, can
      only be achieved with "real" telematic solutions. The alternative of
      pharmaceutical prescription transmission via secure network connections or via
      electronic health card provides a considerable empowerment to the patients.
      Electronic prescribing, however, does not provide direct advantages to patients. 
      Benefits for them can be realised by a drug documentation system, ready to
      identify contraindications or multiple prescriptions. The patients' acceptance of
      the system to be established therefore largely depends on the concurrent
      introduction of both elements.

TI  - Shoulder dystocia: are historic risk factors reliable predictors?
PG  - 1933-5; discussion 1935-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to determine the rate of associated risk factors for
      shoulder dystocia from a large cohort of patients delivered within our Southern
      California perinatal program. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective analysis was
      performed of patients delivered from January 1991 to June 2001. Patients with and
      without shoulder dystocia were identified from our computer-stored perinatal
      database and compared. Statistical methods used included: chi 2 test, t test,
      calculation of odds ratios, and Fisher exact test, as indicated. RESULTS: Among
      the 267,228 vaginal births during the study period, there were 1,686 cases of
      shoulder dystocia (rate 0.6%). Rates for operative vaginal delivery, diabetes,
      epidural use, multiparity, and postdatism were similar among cases with and
      without shoulder dystocia. The clinical triad of oxytocin use, labor induction,
      and birth weight greater than 4,500 g yielded a cumulative odds ratio of 23.2
      (95% CI 17.3-31.0) for shoulder dystocia, but its sensitivity and positive
      predictive value were only 12.4% and 3.4%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Historic
      obstetric risk factors for shoulder dystocia are not useful predictors for the
      event. Furthermore, although shoulder dystocia was observed more frequently with 
      increasing birth weight, current limitations in estimating birth weight
      antenatally with accuracy preclude its practical use as a reliable predictor.

TI  - En-bloc kidney transplantation in the United states: an analysis of united
      network of organ sharing (UNOS) data from 1987 to 2003.
PG  - 1513-7
AB  - With increasing donor organ shortages, en-bloc kidney (EBK) transplantation is an
      alternative to utilize very young or very old donor age cadaver kidneys for
      transplantation. Several single-center series have reported excellent graft
      survival (GS). We sought to determine national level registry-based patterns for 
      GS and determine adjusted hazard ratios (AHR) for graft loss after EBK versus
      single kidney (SK) cadaver transplants. Data reported to UNOS from 1987 to 2003
      were analyzed using PHREG (SAS version 8.1) statistical procedures. Proportional 
      hazards models were constructed that included multiple donor, recipient and
      surgical variables. Of the 2160 EBK transplants reported, 77% were from donors < 
      5 years of age. EBK transplants had superior GS to SK transplants, when donor age
      was restricted to < 5 years (AHR 0.708, p < 0.001). GS at 1, 3 and 5 years
      post-transplant was superior with EBK (85%, 76% and 71%) versus SK (81%, 68%, 63%
      and p < 0.001 at all time points). EBK transplants from very young donors were
      associated with a significantly lower rate of delayed graft function than SK
      transplants (17.9% versus 23.4%, p < 0.001). National registry data suggest that 
      EBK transplants present a viable option for transplantation of very young donor
      kidneys.

PG  - 635-9
AB  - Specific legal issues arise from the distance of the participants in health
      telematics. Substandard care not meeting the state of the art can yield
      malpractice litigation, especially if a diagnosis or therapy conveyed via
      telematics proves to be deficient. On the other hand, communication deficiencies 
      may bring about a reversal of the burden of proof. If the patient's damage can
      not be attributed to the responsible person due to the division of labour, a
      joint liability is likely to be adjudicated. A specific legal risk analysis is
      required as a basis for a risk-adequate design of any application in health
      telematics.

TI  - The relationship of membership in research networks to compliance with treatment 
      guidelines for early-stage breast cancer.
PG  - 471-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Research has shown that older women with breast cancer are less
      likely than younger women to receive treatment in accordance with accepted
      guidelines. Cancer-related research networks (eg, Comprehensive Cancer Centers)
      have been funded by the National Cancer Institute to increase the dissemination
      of new treatment strategies, but little is known about their relationship to
      cancer treatment patterns. OBJECTIVES: We used a 3-level hierarchical regression 
      model to examine the relationship of treating facilities' memberships in cancer
      research networks to compliance with guidelines for primary treatment of early
      stage breast cancer, controlling for patient and facility factors. RESEARCH
      DESIGN: We analyzed data from a database linking SEER registry data and Medicare 
      claims in patients aged 65 years of age or older with early-stage breast cancer
      to data on the treating facility, including variables that indicate membership(s)
      in cancer research networks. SUBJECTS: A total of 16,600 women with stage I or
      stage II breast cancer, diagnosed between 1990 and 1994, and who received
      treatment in one of 423 facilities were studied. MEASURES: The key independent
      variable in this analysis was membership in NCI-funded cancer research networks. 
      The outcome measure is a 3-category variable defined as (1) mastectomy (MAST),
      (2) breast-conserving surgery plus radiation therapy (BCS+RT), or (3) BCS alone. 
      RESULTS: Patients treated at facilities that were members of 2 or more cancer
      research networks were more likely to receive guideline-concordant treatment (ie,
      MAST or BCS+RT) than similar patients treated at non-member facilities.
      CONCLUSIONS: Organizational factors may influence compliance with treatment
      guidelines and be useful in improving the quality of care.

TI  - Rapid implementation of an electronic health record in an academic setting.
PG  - 34-40
AB  - One of the sources of resistance to the implementation of electronic health
      records is that it often takes years to roll out a fully functional system. The
      George Washington University Medical Faculty Associates (MFA) has set a new
      standard for rapid EHR implementation by bringing 99 physicians and 130 residents
      and interns live in less than 30 days in a complex academic setting. MFA
      leveraged a rapid implementation process based on study of previous successful
      implementations. The rollout plan incorporated aggressive hands-on education,
      in-person and virtual training modules for self-review, and a leadership triad of
      physicians, administrators, and information technology experts.

TI  - Management of polytraumatized patients with associated blunt chest trauma: a
      comparison of two European countries.
PG  - 293-302
AB  - BACKGROUND: Blunt chest trauma represents one of the most common injuries in
      polytrauma patients. Blunt chest injury complicating polytrauma is associated
      with significant prolongation of intensive care stay. Further, it has a great
      impact on the timing of fixation of skeletal injuries, possibly contributing to
      adverse outcome. The purpose of this study is to assess whether there are any
      differences in the management and outcome of polytrauma patients with blunt chest
      trauma between trauma units in two different countries. Detailed information
      about advantages and disadvantages of these two systems might allow optimising
      the management of blunt chest trauma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This investigation
      was performed using the polytrauma database of the German Trauma Society and the 
      British Trauma Audit Research Network. After the definition of the inclusion
      abbreviated injury scale (AIS(chest) > or = 3) and injury severity score (ISS >
      16) and exclusion (AIS(head/neck) > or = 2, referral from outside institutions)
      criteria, patients were recruited solely from these databases. RESULTS: 188
      patients from the German database and 181 patients from the British database were
      enrolled in this study. Demographic data and injury pattern of the two patient
      populations did not significantly differ. The volume of initial red blood cell
      transfusion and length of the intensive care stay were significantly higher in
      Germany (p < 0.05). Mortality in the UK was 9% higher than in Germany (p =
      0.057). Time to death in non-survivors was also significantly longer in Germany
      (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The reasons for the differences regarding survival times
      and survival rates seem to be multiple. German patients received more red blood
      cells, had a longer hospital stay in intensive care and a better survival rate.
      The use of kinetic therapy in Germany, not standard in the UK, may contribute to 
      a more favourable outcome.

TI  - A secure protocol to distribute unlinkable health data.
PG  - 485-9
AB  - Health data that appears anonymous, such as DNA records, can be re-identified to 
      named patients via location visit patterns, or trails. This is a realistic
      privacy concern which continues to exist because data holders do not collaborate 
      prior to making disclosures. In this paper, we present STRANON, a novel
      computational protocol that enables data holders to work together to determine
      records that can be disclosed and satisfy a formal privacy protection model.
      STRANON incorporates a secure encrypted environment, so no data holder reveals
      information until the trails of disclosed records are provably unlinkable. We
      evaluate STRANON on real-world datasets with known susceptibilities and
      demonstrate data holders can release significant quantities of data with zero
      trail re-identifiability.

TI  - How disease surveillance systems can serve as practical building blocks for a
      health information infrastructure: the Indiana experience.
PG  - 286-90
AB  - Although many organizations are beginning to develop strategies to implement and 
      study regional and national health information exchanges, there are few
      operational examples to date. The Indiana Network for Patient Care (INPC) is an
      example of a currently operational Regional Health Information Organization
      (RHIO) built upon a foundation of open, robust healthcare information standards. 
      Having demonstrated the scalability of this design, the Indiana State Department 
      of Health (ISDH) contracted with the Regenstrief Institute to implement a
      statewide disease surveillance system incorporating encounter data from all 114
      Indiana hospitals with emergency departments. We describe the 4-year
      implementation plan, including our design rationale and how we plan to address
      the specific implementation challenges of data collection, connectivity in
      diverse environments and current hospital buy-in. To date, 36 hospitals are in
      various stages of engagement, with 19 hospitals actively providing real-time
      surveillance data. We will discuss how this project creates the foundation for a 
      potential statewide health information exchange.

TI  - The implementation of electronic services: planned or organic growth?
PG  - 187-93
AB  - The literature on innovation suggests that projects are successful when rigorous 
      project management is mixed judiciously with 'organic' development. This paper
      argues that organic growth can play a substantial role in the implementation of
      electronic services in healthcare settings. Evidence for organic growth is
      presented, based on a study of email use. Methods are presented for investigating
      email use in health service settings in the National Health Service (NHS) in
      Bradford, England. Geographical information systems (GIS) outputs and social
      network analyses are presented. The results demonstrate a fivefold increase in
      the use of email over a 13-month period, which is shown to be largely independent
      of the growth in the number of organisations using the network. They also
      demonstrate a marked increase in the complexity of the patterns of email use over
      the period.

TI  - Modeling electronic discharge summaries as a simple temporal constraint
      satisfaction problem.
PG  - 55-63
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To model the temporal information contained in medical narrative
      reports as a simple temporal constraint satisfaction problem. DESIGN: A
      constraint satisfaction problem is defined by time points and constraints
      (inequalities between points). A time interval comprises a pair of points and a
      constraint. Five complete electronic discharge summaries and paragraphs from 226 
      other discharge summaries were studied. Medical events were represented as
      intervals, and assertions about events were represented as constraints. Through a
      consensus process, a set of encoding procedures and a list of issues related to
      encoding were generated. MEASUREMENTS: Instances of temporal disjunction and
      contradiction and distribution of temporal constraints were used. RESULTS: An
      average of 95 medical events (range, 46-151) and 234 temporal assertions (range, 
      118-388) were identified per complete discharge summary. Nondefinitional
      assertions were explicit (36%) or implicit (64%) and absolute (17%), qualitative 
      (72%), or metric (11%). Implicit assertions were based on domain knowledge and
      assumptions, e.g., the section of the report determined the ordering of events.
      Issues included linking events, intermittence, periodicity, granularity,
      vagueness, ambiguity, uncertainty, and plans. ions such as intermittence were not
      represented explicitly. The temporal network was sparse: Only 0.80% (range,
      0.42%-1.38%) of possible constraints were instantiated. No instances of
      discontinuous temporal disjunction were found in the complete summaries or the
      226 paragraphs. One instance of temporal contradiction was found (intrareport
      rate of 0.2 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.005-1.114). CONCLUSION: A simple 
      temporal constraint satisfaction problem appears sufficient to represent most
      temporal assertions in discharge summaries and may be useful for encoding
      electronic medical records.

      algorithm of medical images.
PG  - 239-43
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The goal of this work is to improve the usability of a non-rigid
      registration software for medical images. METHOD: We have built a registration
      grid service in order to use the interactivity of a visualization workstation and
      the computing power of a cluster. On the user side, the system is composed of a
      graphical interface that interacts in a complex and fluid manner with the
      registration software running on a remote cluster. CONCLUSION: Although the
      transmission of images back and forth between the computer running the user
      interface and the cluster running the registration service adds to the total
      registration time, it provides a user-friendly way of using the registration
      software without heavy infrastructure investments in hospitals. The system
      exhibits good performances even if the user is connected to the grid service
      through a low throughput network such as a wireless network interface or ADSL.

TI  - Automating addiction treatment: enhancing the human experience and creating a fix
      for the future.
PG  - 186-206
AB  - The country's system of providing treatment for people struggling with addiction 
      requires a fundamental overhaul. To address these daunting problems, a group of
      experts from outside the addiction field met in an intensive retreat and
      envisioned a new future for addiction treatment that would use the latest
      available technology. Retreat leaders employed creative techniques to help free
      up thinking beyond incremental improvement ideas. Current and former addicts or
      alcoholics and family members also attended the retreat to provide the panelists 
      with a real-world understanding of their lives. Through this process, the
      panelists generated eight idea categories that visualized future treatments for
      addiction using technology. They were: (1) Integrated System and Record; (2)
      Monitoring/Treatment; (3) Virtual Experiences; (4) Treatment Access and "One Stop
      Shop"; (5) Networks; (6) Tailored Media Campaigns; (7) Diagnostic Tools; and (8) 
      Help for Family. Two stories illustrate how these ideas could help a heroin
      addict and an alcoholic. The sponsors plan another meeting to bring these
      visionary concepts closer to real application.

TI  - The transition from an analog to a digital echocardiography laboratory: the Mayo 
      experience.
PG  - 1214-24
AB  - Our echocardiography laboratory has completed the transition from an analog to a 
      digital imaging laboratory. The process involved a thorough analysis of the
      practice and design of a complete digital solution. After an effective
      implementation of a robust reporting solution, the transition to digital imaging 
      ensued. The implementation plan for digital imaging enabled the transition to be 
      made without adversely affecting the practice, which has an average daily
      examination load of more than 200 patients. Full-load testing simulations were
      required on high-end image processing review workstations, high-speed local area 
      network connections to each imaging suite, and new clustered imaging servers. We 
      had to test the ability of approximately 100 ultrasound machines with 3
      idiosyncratic ultrasound platforms to allow digital image transfer to the new
      imaging servers over the local area network. Our sonographer, allied health, and 
      physician staff of more than 250 persons had to be trained to adapt to important 
      changes that the digital echocardiographic image acquisition and review platform 
      would have on their specific roles in the laboratory. The efficiency of the
      implementation, reporting, and imaging resulted in improved staff resource
      allocation. The lessons learned may benefit laboratories with a similar interest 
      in making the transition to a digital imaging laboratory with minimal effect on
      patient scheduling and staff satisfaction. The effect of the transition to a
      completely digital laboratory on operating expenses, imaging, and reviewing
      systems and the impact on the clinical practice of echocardiography at our
      institution are presented, with emphasis on the particular aspects of
      transitioning to digital imaging.

TI  - All Kids Count 1991-2004: developing information systems to improve child health 
      and the delivery of immunizations and preventive services.
PG  - S3-15
AB  - The All Kids Count program began in late 1991 with funding from The Robert Wood
      Johnson Foundation. The purpose was to improve child health and the delivery of
      immunizations and preventive services through the development of health
      information systems. All Kids Count concluded in mid-2004 having worked directly 
      with 38 state and local health agencies through its grant and Connections
      program. The lessons learned from the 13-year program are applicable to other
      public health and medical care initiatives. Health information systems projects
      should: (1) involve stakeholders from the beginning, (2) recognize the complexity
      of establishing a population-based information system, (3) develop the
      policy/business/value case for information systems, (4) define the requirements
      of the system to support users' needs, (5) develop information systems according 
      to current standards, (6) address common problems collaboratively, (7) plan for
      change, (8) plan boldly but build incrementally, (9) develop a good
      communications strategy, and (10) use the information (even if not perfect).
      Opportunities exist for public health agencies to share their experiences from
      developing immunization registries and integrated child health information
      systems and to develop collaborative approaches to improving the nation's health 
      information infrastructure.

TI  - Monitoring stage-specific trends in melanoma incidence across Europe reveals the 
      need for more complete information on diagnostic characteristics.
PG  - 387-95
AB  - Cutaneous malignant melanoma has been characterized by rapid and steady increases
      in incidence and mortality in white populations. Some reports mentioned declining
      trends in the mean thickness of these tumours, but other studies suggested a
      stable incidence of thick melanomas. The aim of this study was to describe the
      stage distribution of melanomas across Europe, with particular reference to
      temporal trends. Twenty-three cancer registries provided data sets containing
      information on stage and histology, 21 of which were used for a general
      description and nine for trends analyses. Despite a preponderance of missing
      data, interesting patterns emerged: a less favourable stage distribution in
      populations with relatively low incidence, but high case-fatality rates, and a
      favourable trend in stage and histology distribution over time, including a shift
      from later to earlier stages in recent years. Early detection campaigns raising
      awareness for thin lesions can potentially improve melanoma survival rates.
      Monitoring of stage-specific trends in melanoma incidence can assess the impact
      of such interventions. This paper demonstrates the potential utility of
      high-quality, timely cancer registry data in pursuing such public health
      objectives and addresses the need for more complete information on diagnostic
      features of melanoma patients. This will allow more informative evaluations of
      preventive strategies.

TI  - A network-based system to improve care for schizophrenia: the Medical Informatics
      Network Tool (MINT).
PG  - 358-67
AB  - The Medical Informatics Network Tool (MINT) is a software system that supports
      the management of care for chronic illness. It is designed to improve clinical
      information, facilitate teamwork, and allow management of health care quality.
      MINT includes a browser interface for entry and organization of data and
      preparation of real-time reports. It includes personal computer-based
      applications that interact with clinicians. MINT is being used in a project to
      improve the treatment of schizophrenia. At each patient visit, a nurse briefly
      assesses symptoms, side effects, and other key problems and enters this
      information into MINT. When the physician subsequently opens the patient's
      electronic medical record, a window appears with the assessment information, a
      messaging interface, and access to treatment guidelines. Clinicians and managers 
      receive reports regarding the quality of patients' treatment. To date, MINT has
      been used with more than 165 patients and 29 psychiatrists and has supported
      practices that are consistent with improvements in the quality of care.

TI  - Picture archiving and communication system--Part one: Filmless radiology and
      distance radiology.
PG  - 234-41
AB  - Picture archiving and communication system (PACS) is a collection of technologies
      used to carry out digital medical imaging. PACS is used to digitally acquire
      medical images from the various modalities, such as computed tomography (CT),
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound, and digital projection radiography.
      The image data and pertinent information are transmitted to other and possibly
      remote locations over networks, where they may be displayed on computer
      workstations for soft copy viewing in multiple locations, thus permitting
      simultaneous consultations and almost instant reporting from radiologists at a
      distance. Data are secured and archived on digital media such as optical disks or
      tape, and may be automatically retrieved as necessary. Close integration with the
      hospital information system (HIS)--radiology information system (RIS) is critical
      for system functionality. Medical image management systems are maturing,
      providing access outside of the radiology department to images throughout the
      hospital via the Ethernet, at different hospitals, or from a home workstation if 
      teleradiology has been implemented.

TI  - A comparison of the recording of 30 common childhood conditions in the Doctor's

PG  - 21-31
AB  - In this article we compare the recording of 30 common childhood conditions in two
      general practice databases of anonymised computerised medical records based on
      fundamentally different systems--the Doctor's Independent Network (DIN) database 
      (Torex system) and the General Practice Research Database (GPRD) (In Practice
      Systems). Analysing the records of all children born 1990-1993 and followed for 5
      years we found comparable results for most conditions, but differences between
      the hierarchical structures of the diagnostic coding systems (Read in DIN, OXMIS 
      in GPRD) led to some differences between the databases. Practice variation was
      marked, but comparable between databases. Variation was greatest in conditions
      that are poorly defined clinically.

TI  - How (not) to protect genomic data privacy in a distributed network: using trail
      re-identification to evaluate and design anonymity protection systems.
PG  - 179-92
AB  - The increasing integration of patient-specific genomic data into clinical
      practice and research raises serious privacy concerns. Various systems have been 
      proposed that protect privacy by removing or encrypting explicitly identifying
      information, such as name or social security number, into pseudonyms. Though
      these systems claim to protect identity from being disclosed, they lack formal
      proofs. In this paper, we study the erosion of privacy when genomic data, either 
      pseudonymous or data believed to be anonymous, are released into a distributed
      healthcare environment. Several algorithms are introduced, collectively called
      RE-Identification of Data In Trails (REIDIT), which link genomic data to named
      individuals in publicly available records by leveraging unique features in
      patient-location visit patterns. Algorithmic proofs of re-identification are
      developed and we demonstrate, with experiments on real-world data, that
      susceptibility to re-identification is neither trivial nor the result of bizarre 
      isolated occurrences. We propose that such techniques can be applied as system
      tests of privacy protection capabilities.

TI  - Soft networks for bridging the gap between research and practice: illuminative
      evaluation of CHAIN.
PG  - 1174
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To explore the process of knowledge exchange in an informal email
      network for evidence based health care, to illuminate the value of the service
      and its critical success factors, and to identify areas for improvement. DESIGN: 
      Illuminative evaluation. SETTING: Targeted email and networking service for UK
      healthcare practitioners and researchers. PARTICIPANTS: 2800 members of a
      networking service. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Tracking of email messages, interviews
      with core staff, and a qualitative analysis of messages, postings from focus
      groups, and invited and unsolicited feedback to the service. RESULTS: The
      informal email network helped to bridge the gap between research and practice by 
      serving as a rich source of information, providing access to members'
      experiences, suggestions, and ideas, facilitating cross boundary collaboration,
      and enabling participation in networking at a variety of levels. Ad hoc groupings
      and communities of practice emerged spontaneously as members discovered common
      areas of interest. CONCLUSION: This study illuminated how knowledge for evidence 
      based health care can be targeted, personalised, and made meaningful through
      informal social processes. Critical success factors include a broad based
      membership from both the research and service communities; a loose and fluid
      network structure; tight targeting of messages based on members' interests; the
      presence of a strong network identity and culture of reciprocity; and the
      opportunity for new members to learn through passive participation.

      technology can be challenging, a basic understanding of wireless networking can
      be sufficient for small-scale deployment. Numerous security mechanisms are
      available to wireless technologies, making it practical, scalable, and affordable
      for healthcare organizations. The decision on the selected security model should 
      take into account the needs for additional server hardware and administrative
      costs. Where wide area network connections exist between cooperative
      organizations, deployment of a distributed security model can be considered to
      reduce administrative overhead. The wireless approach chosen should be dynamic
      and concentrate on the organization's specific environmental needs. Aspects of
      organizational mission, operations, service level, and budget allotment as well
      as an organization's risk tolerance are all part of the balance in the decision
      to deploy wireless technology.

TI  - HIS/RIS/PACS integration: getting to the gold standard.
PG  - 16-24; quiz 25-7
AB  - The technology for acquiring, storing, retrieving, displaying, and distributing
      images has advanced dramatically in recent years. The push is toward
      enterprise-wide image management solutions, where digital images from radiology, 
      cardiology, and other "ologies" are seamlessly linked with information from
      clinical information systems and other databases, and they are accessed
      seamlessly from a single point of end-user interaction. The "gold standard" of
      system integration would provide the platform for improved workflow, patient
      throughput and patient safety, as well as decreased cost. Unfortunately, the gold
      standard remains elusive in most healthcare environments, even those with new
      systems. One of the earliest issues that plagued the progress of hospital
      information system/radiology information systems/picture archiving and
      communication systems (HIS/RIS/PACS) integration was a matter of language between
      Health Level-7 (HL7) and DICOM. This barrier was solved by the broker--a software
      and hardware device that accepts HL7 messages from the RIS then translates, or
      maps, the data to produce DICOM messages for transmission to the PACS.
      Technologist workflow requires patient and exam information from the RIS to flow 
      to the modality. The broker provides support for this by taking advantage of the 
      DICOM Modality Worklist (DMWL). Two primary problems are inherent in most
      brokered configurations. Workflow is driven by paper, and RIS information flows
      in 1 direction only, which leads to duplicative databases. Overcoming the
      limitations of HIS/RIS/PACS connectivity requires industry accepted communication
      protocols/rules. To facilitate this, the Integrating the Health Care Enterprise
      (IHE) initiative was developed. The goal of IHE is to provide end-users improved 
      access to critical patient and clinical information across all systems within the
      healthcare delivery network. While the IHE initiative began to facilitate more
      efficient, predictable, and functional integration between disparate systems,
      vendors still had technology hurdles to overcome. System integration continues to
      be significantly hampered, not by technology limitations, but instead by business
      and political issues. In response to these challenges, several vendors have begun
      to offer consolidated RIS/PACS solutions and/or HIS/RIS/PACS solutions.
      Consequently, the prospect of the gold standard appears to be on the horizon.
      Single vendor consolidated systems are not, however, feasible for deployment in
      many healthcare organizations, and they are not necessarily the panacea.

TI  - [The territorial basis of the Brazilian National Health System: mapping hospital 
      networks].
PG  - 386-402
AB  - This article presents two types of networks organized according to patient
      caseload in health services, concerning both primary hospital care (most frequent
      hospital procedures) and tertiary care (high-cost procedures). Data on inpatient 
      care in Brazil in 2000 obtained from the Hospital Information System of the
      Unified National Health System were aggregated by place of residence and hospital
      location at the municipal level. Both the network structure and the node
      (municipality) hierarchy were established using the dominant flow approach. In
      addition, a typology of flows was applied to indicate the degree of connection
      across the networks. Primary hospital care networks reach most of the country,
      and few municipalities are not connected to the network. Relatively few cities
      provide higher-level services, and almost half of the municipalities are
      unconnected. The Ministry of Health aims to provide access to frequently used
      health services near the users' place of residence, and this goal appears to be
      feasible in the short run. On the other hand, much remains to be done to ensure
      widespread access to tertiary care.

TI  - How wireless LANs can enhance the clinical environment.
PG  - 45-8
AB  - WLANs deployments in health care institutions offer clinicians opportunities to
      increase productivity and improve patient care with additional point-of-care
      access to information systems. However, they are not a panacea. Any data that
      needs guaranteed reliability and protection for outside interference, such as
      real-time cardiac monitoring, should be on networks operating in the Wireless
      Medical Telemetry Service (WMTS) range. The WMTS range, (608-614 MHz, 1395-1400
      MHz, and 1429-1432 MHz), was established in 1999 by the FCC as a protected
      frequency range (in the U.S.) making these products less likely to have
      interference problems than devices operating in the 802.11 range. Security
      challenges must also be addressed as each access point is synonymous with
      installing a RJ45 network jack in the parking lot of a facility and inviting the 
      general public to connect to a network. Also, increased mobility of electronic
      devices means battery power; thus consideration will need to be given to
      charging, maintaining, and disposal of batteries. WLANs offer many advantages
      over conventional wired LANs but they also offer many challenges in addressing
      security and reliability issues. WLANs are not designed to replace conventional
      hard-wired network infrastructure; they are designed to augment the connectivity 
      of LANs. Even with the 802.11 g standard, which supports connectivity up to 54
      Mbps, large medical image files would not have enough bandwidth on this type of
      wireless network. Wireless networks can enhance the health care technology
      infrastructure but proper selection of technology and focus on the security and
      reliability during the planning and installation is a definite requirement.

      program of assessments, feedback, and training.
PG  - 78-86
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of a program of
      repeated assessments, feedback, and training on the quality of coded clinical
      data in general practice. DESIGN: A prospective uncontrolled intervention study
      was conducted in a general practice research network. MEASUREMENTS: Percentage of
      recorded consultations with a coded problem title and percentage of patients
      receiving a specific drug (e.g., tamoxifen) who had the relevant morbidity code
      (e.g., breast cancer) were calculated. Annual period prevalence of 12 selected
      morbidities was compared with parallel data derived from the fourth National
      Study of Morbidity Statistics from General Practice (MSGP4). RESULTS: The first
      two measures showed variation between practices at baseline, but on repeat
      assessments all practices improved or maintained their levels of coding. The
      period prevalence figures also were variable, but over time rates increased to
      levels comparable with, or above, MSGP4 rates. Practices were able to provide
      time and resources for feedback and training sessions. CONCLUSION: A program of
      repeated assessments, feedback, and training appears to improve data quality in a
      range of practices. The program is likely to be generalizable to other practices 
      but needs a trained support team to implement it that has implications for cost
      and resources.

TI  - Statistical linkage of treatment to diagnosis for research and monitoring of
      practice patterns.
PG  - 282-6
AB  - OBJECTIVES: At each patient contact general practitioners enter information about
      the diagnoses and the interventions in the electronic medical record (EMR)
      system. If there is only one diagnosis during a single patient-physician contact,
      then a causal connection between the diagnosis and the intervention is
      established. Otherwise it is uncertain what may have been the cause of the
      intervention. METHODS: Ideally the general practitioners would record a match
      between each intervention and the diagnosis that justifies it. However, most EMR 
      software is not capable of recording explanatory matches. Furthermore, supplying 
      the matches is a resource-demanding task. In this study the general practitioners
      were supplied with a matching module for the EMR, so data with full matching
      between intervention and diagnosis was collected (our "gold standard"). The study
      models how close the full matching can be recreated by model linkage using
      different kinds of simple assumptions. RESULTS: The modeling demonstrates a raise
      in the measure of prediction (sensitivity) from 41.9 percent for a completely
      random linkage to 90.9 percent based on simple assumptions in the model. The
      small substantial potential further gain makes it less attractive to apply more
      intricate assumptions or use more complex modeling (including neural networks).
      CONCLUSIONS: The perspective of the study lies in the support of the general
      practitioners with software for comparison of their decisions with those of their
      peers and also with guidelines. Thus a system for simple quality assurance and
      awareness to untypical decisions could be incorporated into the electronic
      medical record systems.

TI  - A problem-based e-Learning prototype system for clinical medical education.
PG  - 983-7
AB  - The purpose of this system is to establish virtual medical school (VMS) as the
      platform of e-learning center, which integrates collaborative and self-directed
      learning environment by virtual group, classroom and library, and automatically
      converts valuable clinical case from Hospital Information System (HIS) database
      into virtual patient by online authoring tools for problem-based e-learning. In
      this system, the VMS provides a problem-based e-learning environment, and
      utilizes HIS to capture and store valuable clinical cases. All medical students
      and residents now have the opportunity to learn from these typical cases online. 
      The VMS at National Taiwan University has the potential to develop into a
      national medical education network for the meditation and provision of
      comprehensive medical resources. The system will use the international standard
      SCORM 1.2 to develop teaching material and assist with the HL7 v2.4, CDA v1.0
      standards to connect Electronic Medical Record (EMR) systems in the hospital. It 
      can provide resources sharing among medical centers by using high transportation 
      ability of Grid Computing integrated with the broadband video platform, Access
      Grid, and personal multiple point videoconference platform, Multi-video, to
      popularize the application of e-learning in clinical medical education.

TI  - MET system: a new approach to m-health in emergency triage.
PG  - 101-8
AB  - The MET (Mobile Emergency Triage) system is an m-health application that supports
      emergency triage of various types of acute pain at the point of care. The system 
      is designed for use in the Emergency Department (ED) of a hospital and to aid
      physicians in disposition decisions. Given patient's condition, MET recommends a 
      triage by consulting decision rules stored in the system's knowledge base. The
      rules have been created using a data mining method (based on rough set
      methodology) applied to data collected during a retrospective chart study and
      verified by the clinicians. MET is designed following the extended client-server 
      architecture, suited for weak-connectivity conditions, where stable connection
      between clients and a server cannot be provided. The MET server interacts with
      the hospital's patient information system in order to retrieve information about 
      patients admitted to the ED. It also stores current patients' demographic and
      clinical data to be exchanged with mobile clients. The MET mobile client, running
      on a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), is used for collecting clinical data and
      supporting triage decisions. The support function runs solely on the client side,
      thus it can be invoked anytime and anywhere, even if there is no communication
      link with the server (e.g., there is no wireless network available in the ED).
      Due to implementation on PDAs and working in weak-connectivity conditions, the
      MET system is very well suited for use in the ED and fits seamlessly into the
      regular clinical workflow without introducing any hindrances or disruptions that 
      are often reported when using stationary (i.e., working on desktop computers)
      clinical systems. The system facilitates patient-centered service and timely,
      high quality patient management. It provides recommendations using a limited
      amount of clinical data, normally available at the point of care. Furthermore, it
      provides a possibility for the structured evaluation of this data by an attending
      physician.

TI  - Universal electronic health record MUDR.
PG  - 190-201
AB  - One of the important research tasks of the European Centre for Medical
      Informatics, Statistics and Epidemiology - Cardio (EuroMISE Centre - Cardio) is
      the applied research in the field of electronic health record design including
      electronic medical guidelines and intelligent systems for data mining and
      decision support. The research in the field of data storage and data acquisition 
      was inspired by several European projects and standards, mostly by the I4C and
      TripleC projects. Based on experience gathered during cooperation in the TripleC 
      project we have proposed a description of a flexible information storage model.
      The motivation for this effort was the large variability of the set of collected 
      features in different departments - including temporal variability. Therefore, a 
      dynamically extensible and modifiable structure of items is needed. In our model 
      we use two basic structures called the knowledge base and data files. The main
      function of the knowledge base is to express the hierarchy of collectable
      features - medical concepts, their characteristics and relations among them. The 
      data files structure is used to store the patient's data itself. These two
      structures can be described using graph theory expressions. Based on this model, 
      a three-layer system architecture named "Multimedia Distributed Record" (MUDR)
      has been proposed and implemented. During the implementation, modern technologies
      such as Web Services, SOAP and XML were used. For the practical usage of EHR
      MUDR, an intelligent application called MUDRc (MUDR Client) was created. It
      enables physicians to use EHR MUDR in a flexible way. During the development
      process, maximum emphasis was placed on user-friendliness and comfortable usage
      of this application. Several methods of data entry can be used: pre-defined
      forms, direct entry into the tree data structure of the EHR MUDR, or automatic
      unstructured free-text report parsing and data retrieval. The system enables fast
      and simple importing and exporting of data as well. The system integrates modern 
      multimedia formats (X-ray photos, sonography and other pictures, video-sequences,
      audio records) as well as progressive methods of decision support systems
      realized by medical guidelines and other modules.

TI  - Evaluation of KNAVE-II: a tool for intelligent query and exploration of patient
      data.
PG  - 648-52
AB  - We present the results of a preliminary evaluation of KNAVE-II, a distributed
      knowledge-based computational framework for visualization, interpretation, and
      exploration of longitudinal clinical data and of multiple levels of concepts
      derivable from these data. KNAVE-II uses a distributed architecture to access at 
      run-time clinical time-oriented data, a domain-specific knowledge base containing
      properties of the clinical data, and a knowledge-based problem-solving method for
      computing on-the-fly interpretations of these data. The purpose of the evaluation
      was to compare efficiency and user satisfaction when answering clinical queries
      of variable complexity about clinical time-oriented data using KNAVE-II, versus
      using methods available in standard clinical settings: paper chart or electronic 
      spreadsheet (ESS). Subjects answered high-complexity queries significantly faster
      using KNAVE-II than when using paper or ESS. User satisfaction with KNAVE-II was 
      significantly superior compared to satisfaction using paper or ESS, based on a
      standard usability scale. Users also explicitly ranked KNAVE-II as superior to
      paper and the ESS.

TI  - The oncological nurse assistant: a web-based intelligent oncological nurse
      advisor.
PG  - 573-7
AB  - As more people get cancer the need for medical guidance increases. In Norway, one
      of the providers of medical guidelines is the Norwegian Cancer Association where 
      oncological nurses assist people with a cancer diagnosis or their relatives. The 
      nurses search through both national and internal guide-books and web pages. The
      input to this process is mostly dis-charge letters. The whole process is time
      consuming. To serve more patients, PaSent, a web-based intelligent oncological
      nurse advisor, has been developed. Through using discharge letters as input to
      our neural network based information retrieval system PaSent, we have been able
      to provide relevant medical information to the patient as well as to the health
      personnel themselves. The PaSent search method uses predefined knowledge about
      the context, paired with the vocabulary of the input document, to compute a
      relevance measure for a potential result document. The system has been validated 
      by oncological nurses and medical doctors. In the reported experiments, the
      achieved search results from PaSent have been comparable to the results achieved 
      by the health personnel.

TI  - Web-based submission, archive, and review of radiotherapy data for clinical
      quality assurance: a new paradigm.
PG  - 1427-36
AB  - PURPOSE: To report on the implementation of a web-based system (the Resource
      Center for Emerging Technologies [RCET] System) that provides immediate access to
      the patient radiotherapy planning and delivery data for clinical quality
      assurance (QA) by the experts. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An infrastructure of
      comprehensive tools required for preparation, submission, auto-archiving,
      web-based review, and retrieval of diagnostic images, treatment planning images, 
      and radiation therapy objects has been developed. These tools represent
      approximately 1.1 million lines of computer code development in seven languages
      (V, C++, Visual Basic, Java, ASP, HTML, and SQL) and consist of a secure
      auto-anonymizing upload and auto-archiving patient database, a web-based secure
      object archiving network system, a web-based rapid review tool, a web-based
      upload/download tool, and a personal computer client data application for data
      object preparation, visualization, and submission, named NetSys. The RCET system 
      enables users to share radiotherapy data in a secure environment. This paradigm
      of electronic data exchange makes remote peer review very efficient and
      convenient. RESULTS: The RCET system can help the radiation therapy community
      ensure consistent evaluation of its therapies. It will encourage proactive QA. An
      example of proactive clinical QA would be to provide atlases of target and
      critical structure definitions, to serve as class solutions, as well as dose
      prescription, specification, and reporting examples for guidance to the radiation
      oncologists in the community. The web-based clinical quality assurance is ideally
      suited for emerging technologies in radiation therapy that generate complex and
      voluminous multimodality imaging and planning data. CONCLUSIONS: The RCET system 
      enables users to share multimodality imaging data, radiation therapy planning,
      and delivery data on demand. Our design paradigm will allow rapid peer review of 
      radiotherapy data through a simple personal computer-based web browser.

TI  - CSCW-based system development methodology for health-care information systems.
PG  - 273-82
AB  - Health-care organizations are now moving toward integrated delivery systems to
      provide high-quality care, as they are being held to an ever-increasing scope of 
      accountabilities. Distributed applications such as telemedicine and electronic
      patient records (EPR) are seen as key requirements for the future to deliver cost
      effective and high-quality health-care services. This initiative would provide
      dynamic environments for health professionals to access patient information and
      thereby increase the decision-making capacities on patient care procedures.
      Although telemedicine applications and EPR contribute to the improvement of
      healthcare services, poor communication mechanisms and practices negatively
      impact on quality of service (QoS) in teamwork environments of patient care.
      Awareness and responsiveness are becoming important factors in dynamic group
      collaborative work environments in healthcare facilities. This paper reports on a
      detailed case study of group communication patterns in a patient service
      environment. Further, an ethnographic approach that addresses group
      communications patterns, identifies tools and techniques in light of
      Computer-Supported Collaborative Work (CSCW), which requires the application of a
      number of disciplines including sociology, organizational science, psychology,
      and computer science. In cooperative work environments, it is important to
      understand the activities of others for human interaction and communication in
      general. This is very important for future development of CSCW-based distributed 
      architectures that focus on the challenges of improving QoS in healthcare
      environments.

TI  - The General Practice Research Network: the capabilities of an electronic patient 
      management system for longitudinal patient data.
PG  - 483-9
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the potential of a general practice research database
      derived directly from de-identified electronic medical records to provide
      national prescribing data in Australia. To observe the utilisation of a
      computer-based patient management system over time. To evaluate the impact of the
      research network participation on data quality in participants' electronic
      records. METHOD: A random sample of 297 general practitioners (GPs) from 128
      practices provided longitudinal patient data from electronic medical records
      (using Medical Director software) retrospectively from 1 January 1999 to April
      2002. The General Practice Research Network (GPRN) database contains
      approximately 600,000 patients, representing over 4 million prescriptions from 4 
      million encounters. The quality and representativeness of data for prescribing,
      morbidity and software usage were evaluated by comparison with National data.
      RESULTS: Older GPs (> 55) were under-represented, perhaps due to lower computer
      usage rates, but patient visits were similar to the national distribution. Over
      time, there were increases in: the quality of prescribing data (with reason for
      visit/prescription being compulsorily recorded); recording of non-prescribing
      visits; and the use of other features of the electronic patient management
      software. CONCLUSIONS: Data derived from electronic general practice records is
      of sufficient quality to be used to provide national prescribing estimates and
      has potential value for pharmacoepidemiology and population health monitoring.
      Such longitudinal data has previously been unavailable in Australia. Monitoring
      of software usage demonstrates the evolution of the Australian GP user and will
      be increasingly useful in assessing and improving the quality of electronic
      medical records.

TI  - Design and implementation of a common drug information database for a university 
      hospital.
PG  - 156-61
AB  - BACKGROUND: Providing high quality problem-oriented drug information relies on
      the ability to easily collect appropriate background information on clinical
      cases, to access relevant information from published sources by defined search
      strategies and to store and retrieve previously answered questions. To do this
      efficiently, an easy-to-use, flexible and reliable drug information database is
      necessary. METHODS: We designed and implemented an Intranet-based drug
      information database for a major university hospital in Germany. The overall
      design and the technical details of its design are discussed. We developed a
      generic, XML-based data model for pharmaceutical inquiries including a
      MeSH-oriented system of 99 pharmaceutical qualifiers to enable efficient indexing
      of questions and the searching of indexed questions. RESULTS: The system provides
      query statistics and various search algorithms. The software implementation takes
      into account recent FDA recommendations for software used in clinical trials;
      internal review for quality control is supported. The database currently consists
      of 4224 records after 3.5 years of operation. Each inquiry consists of 50 items, 
      18 of 50 are categorized; 135 text elements support data entry. Our evaluation is
      focused on technical feasibility, user acceptance and query patterns. CONCLUSION:
      The intensive use and widespread acceptance of the database indicates a need for 
      a computerized drug information system and suggests that Intranet technology can 
      perform this task.

TI  - Telecardiology for effective healthcare services.
PG  - 149-59
AB  - Continuous monitoring of the electrocardiogram (ECG) and other signals related to
      current heart activity are necessary for patients who are suffering from cardiac 
      diseases. This paper deals with the work that has been carried out to transmit
      ECGs from remote sites. Software has been developed which enables the uploading
      of ECG data from a patient so that the physician can monitor the state of the
      patient from a distance and at the same time may consult other experts for a
      second opinion. Records can only be examined by the authorized physician after
      proper registration and diagnosis or prescription may be sent back to the
      referring site. Further consultation with the patient through a 'chat' facility
      is also possible. The suitability of the system over transport control protocol
      (TCP), internet protocol (IP), local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN) 
      and World Wide Web (WWW) has been assessed. The bandwidth, latency, availability,
      security and ubiquity have also been discussed. A study has also been undertaken 
      in order to make the system compatible with available bandwidths and to find out 
      which one out of a number of available techniques is most efficient for ECG data 
      compression. The results indicate that the scheme is suitable for telecardiology 
      and can form part of an overall telemedicine system in a health care network.

TI  - A project plan for construction and cabling of picture archiving and
      communication system network.
PG  - 645-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine a network solution to meet the network requirements of
      the heavy data flow, load balance, and potential network storms from expansion of
      picture archiving and communication system (PACS) application. METHODS: Intel
      Netstructure 480T Giga Switch was used as the main switch and connected to each
      building by fiber channel at 1 Giga speed to archive 100 MB/s to each port. At
      the same time, the in-dependence of the original network construction was
      physically kept. The layer 3 and 4 switchers were used as load balance to reduce 
      the heavy load of the network, and all the cabling for PACS used the super CAT5
      along with the Intel NetStructure 1520 to prepare for potential network storms.
      RESULTS: An advanced intranet was set up to fully meet the high standard
      requirement of the PACS. The foundation for upgrading the whole network system to
      1 Giga application was built to achieve sharing and transmission of images,
      information, and patient data within the hospital. The base was established for
      the standardized management of the hospital. CONCLUSION: Good planning is the
      first step in setting up PACS, and the equipment forms the necessary platform to 
      run PACS and all kinds of hospital information system (HIS). The networking
      construction is the foundation of e-hospital.

TI  - Data security issues arising from integration of wireless access into healthcare 
      networks.
PG  - 163-75
AB  - The versatility of having Ethernet speed connectivity without wires is rapidly
      driving adoption of wireless data networking by end users across all types of
      industry. Designed to be easy to configure and work among diverse platforms,
      wireless brings online data to mobile users. This functionality is particularly
      useful in modern clinical medicine. Wireless presents operators of networks
      containing or transmitting sensitive and confidential data with several new types
      of security vulnerabilities, and potentially opens previously protected core
      network resources to outside attack. Herein, we review the types of
      vulnerabilities, the tools necessary to exploit them, and strategies to thwart a 
      successful attack.

TI  - [NADIS 2000, development of an electronic medical record for patients infected by
      HIV, HBV and HCV].
PG  - 299-303
AB  - OBJECTIVE: to develop an electronic medical record for patients living with HIV, 
      HBV or HCV in order to improve their management, facilitate communication between
      all the caregivers, and to create a useful medical database for research and
      assessments. This project (NADIS 2000) involved 6 centres of Infectious Diseases 
      in France in partnership with Fedialis Medica (subsidiary of the GSK group in
      France). METHODS: A specifications sheets was drawn-up by a piloting Committee
      regrouping the various correspondents in each centre and a computer expert
      representing Fedialis Medica. A Scientific and Development committee regrouped
      the heads of departments of each centre and the representatives from Fedialis
      Medica and GSK and was charged with defining the general concept of the project
      and guaranteeing the scientific and clinical aspects. RESULTS: NADIS 2000 version
      1.0 was activated in the departments of infectious diseases in Nice and Toulouse 
      in November 2000 and in others Units at the end of 2001. NADIS 2000 permitted
      real-time use by the physicians in the Outpatients and Day-care Units and was
      easily handled by all the practitioners. Its use was eased by the principles
      clearly defined before its application (department project, progressive but
      exhaustive use), an intuitive interface simulating a consultation, and functions 
      proposing direct benefits for the physicians (graphical visualization of the
      biological variables, printing of prescriptions and letters). CONCLUSION: The
      activation and input methods of NADIS 2000 are user friendly and the physicians
      find it rapidly easy to use. New functional aspects are being developed as well
      as its use in other hospital departments.

TI  - Virtual instrumentation and real-time executive dashboards. Solutions for health 
      care systems.
PG  - 58-76
AB  - Successful organizations have the ability to measure and act on key indicators
      and events in real time. By leveraging the power of virtual instrumentation and
      open architecture standards, multidimensional executive dashboards can empower
      health care organizations to make better and faster data-driven decisions. This
      article will highlight how user-defined virtual instruments and dashboards can
      connect to hospital information systems (e.g., admissions/discharge/transfer
      systems, patient monitoring networks) and use statistical process control to
      "visualize" information and make timely, data-driven decisions. The case studies 
      described will illustrate enterprisewide solutions for: bed management and census
      control, operational management, data mining and business intelligence
      applications, and clinical applications (physiological data acquisition and wound
      measurement and analysis).

AB  - Electronic discharge letters are in many cases insufficient as a recipe for
      further treatment and recovery. Through using discharge letters as input to our
      neural network based information retrieval system Pasent, we have been able to
      provide relevant medical information. The Pasent search method uses predefined
      knowledge about the context, paired with the vocabulary of the input document, to
      compute a relevance measure for a potential result document. In the reported
      experiments, we achieved search results comparable to the tftdf method without
      building specialised context models for the experiment.

AB  - Face to the development of hospital information system in the "Hopital Europeen
      George Pompidou" (HEGP), computerized patients records made medical data easier
      to analyse than before. We use data-mining technology to analyse intra-hospital
      patients' paths with one year of PMSI data (a French medical information system
      similar to Diagnosis Related Group). METHODS: 1. "sequential patterns mining" was
      used to analyse the most frequent patients' paths, 2. an integrated framework of 
      "association rules mining" and "classification rule mining" was used to build
      prediction rules of patients' paths. RESULT: We construct a rule based prediction
      model, which gives the tendency of the patient's paths between the different
      medical units.

TI  - Mechanism of failure in the treatment of type II endoleak with percutaneous coil 
      embolization.
PG  - 485-91
AB  - PURPOSE: Type II endoleak after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair is 
      a failure of aneurysm sac exclusion with unknown long-term consequences. Elevated
      aneurysm sac pressures documented in these patients have led us to aggressively
      treat type II endoleaks with percutaneous transluminal coil embolization (PTCE). 
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the results and the mechanisms of
      failure of PTCE for type II endoleak. METHODS: One hundred ninety-one patients
      underwent endograft repair of infrarenal aortic aneurysms. Twenty-three of 28
      patients with persistent primary (>3 months) or secondary (new-onset) endoleak
      underwent angiography; 14 of these patients had type II endoleaks. We reviewed
      our endovascular registry data, hospital charts, and radiologic studies of
      patients with type II endoleaks and analyzed the results in those treated with
      PTCE of the inflow vessel. RESULTS: All 14 patients with type II endoleaks were
      men, with a mean age of 76.7 years and a mean preoperative maximal aneurysm
      diameter of 5.7 +/- 1.0 cm. The type II endoleak was primary in 12 patients (86%)
      and secondary in two patients (14%) and iliolumbar in 11 patients (78%) and
      mesenteric in three patients (21%). Although a dominant affluent collateral
      channel (inosculation) was apparent in eight patients (57%), six patients (43%)
      showed a network of collateral vessels (retiform anastomosis). In six patients
      (43%), angiography revealed a second or "outflow" vessel indicative of a complex 
      endoleak. In four patients with retiform iliolumbar type II endoleaks, PTCE was
      not attempted because of the retiform nature of the endoleak. The remaining 10
      patients underwent PTCE, with coil deployment in all 10 and apparent initial
      technical success in nine patients. Follow-up computed tomographic scans revealed
      persistent endoleaks in six patients (60%). Mechanisms of failure included
      persistent flow through the coils in the treated vessel in two patients,
      development of a retiform anastomosis around the coiled vessel in three patients,
      and development of a new mesenteric endoleak after successful occlusion of an
      iliolumbar endoleak in one patient. Two patients underwent repeat PTCE with
      successful aneurysm sac exclusion in one. Internal iliac artery injury
      complicated one of the 12 PTCEs, and the resulting pseudoaneurysm was
      successfully treated with PTCE. Angiographic visualization of an outflow vessel
      (complex endoleak) was associated with PTCE failure (P =.008). CONCLUSION: PTCE
      of type II endoleaks has a high failure rate because of multiple anatomic
      mechanisms.

TI  - Saying goodbye to optical storage technology.
PG  - 16-25
AB  - The days of using optical disk based mass storage devices for high volume
      applications like health care document imaging are coming to an end. The
      price/performance curve for redundant magnetic disks, known as RAID, is now more 
      positive than for optical disks. All types of application systems, across many
      sectors of the marketplace are using these newer magnetic technologies, including
      insurance, banking, aerospace, as well as health care. The main components of
      these new storage technologies are RAID and SAN. SAN refers to storage area
      network, which is a complex mechanism of switches and connections that allow
      multiple systems to store huge amounts of data securely and safely.

TI  - [New development of a cytological examination ordering system at Osaka National
      Hospital].
PG  - 630-4
AB  - Effective and rapid use of cytological data are issue in Japan. We addressed this
      problem by development of an ordering system for cytological examinations at
      Osaka National Hospital. This system is located in the department of pathology
      and is a client-server system that consisted of 1 server and 6 clients. Five of
      the 6 clients are related to cytology and there are connections to microscopes
      with digital cameras. One client is for acceptance of cytological specimens at
      the department of pathology. Through a local area network, 100 Mbps, this system 
      is connected to the hospital information system, which is of the order-entry
      type. After a clinician orders a cytological examination, these data are sent to 
      both the Accounts and Pathology departments. A small bar-code label is
      simultaneously printed out, which is stuck on the form. By checking this label at
      the department of pathology by using a label reader, relevant clinical
      information is sent to the pathology server. After the cytological diagnosis has 
      been made by senior cytotechnologist and cytopathologist, data on the diagnosis
      and microscopic images are sent to the hospital information system. Thus,
      clinicians can review the cytological diagnosis together with the
      photomicrographs. This new cytology system has brought great benefits to both
      cytotechnologist and clinicians with regard to the rapid transfer of cytological 
      examination, and it seems to contribute to more advanced and efficient medical
      care.

TI  - Evaluation in health informatics: social network analysis.
PG  - 179-93
AB  - Social network analysis comprises a set of research methods that can be used to
      analyze the relationships among entities such as people, departments, and
      organizations. The purpose of the analysis is to discover patterns of
      relationships that affect both individual and organizational attitudes and
      behavior such as the adoption, diffusion, and use of new medical informatics
      applications. This paper presents an introduction to the concepts and methods of 
      social network analysis. Several applications to health informatics are
      described.

TI  - Radiology speech recognition: workflow, integration, and productivity issues.
PG  - 95-104
AB  - Continuous voice recognition is now a reality, with at least 3 major vendors
      providing independent systems for radiology departments. However, to be truly
      useful, such systems must be integrated into the overall medical informatics
      architecture including order entry into the radiology information system, the
      ability to receive orders from the radiology information system, acceptance and
      transcription of dictation, and transmission of validated reports to the hospital
      information system (HIS)for billing capture. In addition, the system should
      permit sufficient flexibility to permit radiologists to operate in multiple
      modes: real-time recognition, batch processing, or spooling of audio files for
      later transcription by human agents, which is especially useful for very
      difficult accents. This article demonstrates the various modes of operation for 2
      recognition systems that have been used in our center, describes the basics of
      their recognition models, examines the HL7 messages required for medical
      informatics integration, and finally illustrates the effect on report turnaround 
      times.

AB  - The paper shows that the currently available Russian and foreign computer medical
      monitors (CMMs) may generally solve the simplest tasks of data visualization,
      recording, and archiving. It is justified that to enhance the "intellectuality"
      of CMMs, it is necessary to turn to the solution of the problems and tasks of
      medical monitoring, by using the whole range of methods for biosignal detection
      and processing, which has been accumulated in modern radio engineering, in the
      theory of communication, and in engineering and medical cybernetics.

TI  - The epiphany of data warehousing technologies in the pharmaceutical industry.
PG  - S3-13
AB  - The highly competitive pharmaceutical industry has seen many external changes to 
      its landscape as companies consume each other increasing their pipelines while
      removing redundant functions and processes. Internally, companies have sought to 
      streamline the discovery and development phases in an attempt to improve
      candidate selection and reduce the time to regulatory filing. In conjunction with
      efforts to screen and develop more compounds faster and more efficiently,
      database management systems (DBMS) have been developed for numerous groups
      supporting various R&D efforts. An outgrowth of DBMS evolution has been the birth
      of data warehousing. Often confused with DBMS, data warehousing provides a
      conduit for data residing across platforms, networks, and in different data
      structures. Through the use of metadata, the warehouse establishes connectivity
      of varied data stores (operational detail data, ODD) and permits identification
      of data ownership, location and transaction history. This evolution has closely
      mirrored and in some ways been driven by the electronic submission (formerly
      CANDA). The integration of the electronic submissions and document management
      with R&D data warehousing initiatives should provide a platform by which
      companies can address compliance with 21 CFR Part 11. Now more than ever
      "corporate memory" is being extended to the data itself. The when, why and how of
      successes and failures are constantly being probed by R&D management teams. The
      volume of information being generated by today's pharmaceutical companies
      requires mining of historical data on a routine basis. Data warehousing
      represents a core technology to assist in this endeavor. New initiatives in this 
      field address the necessity of data portals through which warehouse data can be
      web-enabled and exploited by diverse data customers both internal and external to
      the company. The epiphany of data warehousing technologies within the
      pharmaceutical industry has begun and promises to change the way in which
      companies process and provide data to regulatory agencies. The improvements in
      drug discovery and reduction in development timelines remain to be seen but would
      seem to be rational if such technology is fully exploited.

TI  - Enterprise digital assistants: the progression of wireless clinical computing.
PG  - 229-33
AB  - By virtue of increasingly pervasive wireless connectivity, the proliferation of
      wireless handheld devices in clinical care is rapidly transforming the concept of
      the personal digital assistant (PDA) to the enterprise digital assistant (EDA).
      Wireless handheld devices are becoming extensions of the central hospital
      information system, in which it's understood that the health care enterprise, not
      the clinician carrying the information-dispensing device, owns the data. The
      practical implication for clinicians is that, despite the potential long-term
      benefits of seamless, just-in-time clinical data access, this paradigm shift
      portends decreased efficiency in the short term, as clinicians duplicate clinical
      data collection on private devices. Assuming eventual clinician acceptance, EDAs 
      can form the basis of a national real-time clinical data acquisition system that 
      ensures uniform prescribing, decision support, and diagnosis, and the means for
      tracking unusual disease presentation patterns that could be indicative of
      bioterrorism or natural disease outbreaks.

TI  - [Electronic dataflow management in radiotherapy: routine use of the DICOM-RT
      protocol].
PG  - 172s-180s
AB  - The DICOM standard protocol of medical image exchange and its extensions to
      radiotherapy data has been implemented in order to enable electronic
      communication between all modalities within our radiology and radiotherapy
      departments. The network architecture used for radiotherapy includes as basic
      elements one CT simulator, several treatment planning systems, one linear
      accelerator fitted with multileaf collimator, one electronic portal imaging
      system and several laser imagers. As customary in radiotherapy departments, our
      equipments are heterogeneous with respect to manufacturers and computer operating
      systems. Choosing to resort to the DICOM-RT protocol spared us the acquisition of
      a proprietary information system because its elementary inter-connectivity
      characteristics can effectively be used for dataflow management. It has the
      advantage to minimally change the user's way of working since the electronic data
      transfer is taking place sequentially from one workstation to the other in a
      manner analogous to what is done with the paper document. Quality assurance
      management of treatments is simplified by the electronic nature of the transfers 
      from the CT-simulation down to the accelerator since modalities interfaces,
      instead of users, are performing consistency checks. This process results in
      substantial time saving, but the DICOM computer interface is requiring a better
      skill that the one needed for operating standard office software. The DICOM-RT
      protocol is presently missing some functionality necessary for its integration
      into our hospital information system. Our experience is however showing that it
      represents a viable and promising solution for a small radiotherapy department.

TI  - Achieving Internet-based efficiencies in a rural IDS: a case study.
PG  - 68-71
AB  - After suffering payment cuts resulting from the Balanced Budget Act of 1997,
      Colorado-Fayette Medical Center (CFMC), a not-for-profit, rural integrated
      delivery system in Texas, wanted to reduce costs by gaining systemwide Internet
      access for its internal information system at a reasonable price. An application 
      service provider affiliated with the Texas Hospital Association, helped CFMC
      achieve its goals for the project by performing a needs assessment, installing a 
      wide-area network (WAN) with Internet access, and training staff. The new WAN
      enabled CFMC to improve its Web presence, allow radiologic image viewing at all
      sites, negotiate more favorable prices from vendors, implement electronic
      communication for staff members, and take advantage of on-line education
      opportunities. CFMC has found that the monthly fee paid to THN is offset by
      savings on long-distance calls, Internet service provider fees, and marketing and
      advertising costs.

AB  - The role of reviewer variation in interpreting outcomes of outpatient clinic
      chart reviews has been poorly studied. The present study used results collected
      from a network-based spreadsheet application (Microsoft Excel), which is widely
      available throughout the Army Medical Department, for chart reviews. Data were

      were reviewed. Results showed a significant improvement in documentation of
      contact with the referring provider from 1998 to 2000 (55.9% in 1998, 81.6% in
      1999, and 80.6% in 2000; p < 0.01 by chi 2 for both). The percentage of charts
      for new consultations with inadequately controlled blood pressure managed
      appropriately improved from 73.7% in 1999 to 89.2% in 2000 (p < 0.01 by chi 2).
      These results persisted in logistic regression analysis controlling for different
      reviewers. In conclusion, widely available office automation tools allow the
      systematic analysis of chart review data with the potential to improve practice
      patterns.

TI  - Medicare, the Internet, and the future of telemedicine.
PG  - N144-50
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Beginning October 1, 2001, the Health Care Financing Administration
      (HCFA) will extend Medicare coverage to a wide range of telemedicine services and
      providers, allowing for medical visits, consultations, mental health services,
      and pharmacologic monitoring of patients living in rural areas. Payment to
      providers will be at a rate similar to that paid without the use of telemedicine.
      Furthermore, Medicare will pay a facility fee of $20 to the originating site per 
      telemedicine session. This article discusses how advances in computer
      connectivity and communication infrastructure, coupled with Medicare
      reimbursement for telemedicine services, present medical providers with a unique 
      opportunity to improve healthcare delivery to their patients, in particular those
      living in rural counties in the United States. DATA SOURCES: Peer-reviewed
      articles published in the literature and industry-specific surveys published on
      the Internet. CONCLUSIONS: There is little doubt that recent changes in HCFA
      reimbursement for telemedicine will have a dramatic impact on the delivery of
      medical care to rural America. By correcting the mistakes of the 1997 Balanced
      Budget Act provisions, Congress has acknowledged telemedicine as a viable,
      potentially life-saving technology. The most likely scenario for the expansion of
      telemedicine services to rural counties will be through networks using Internet
      technology. The expansion of the Internet and broadband infrastructure should
      allow for the establishment of geographically wide and technically robust
      telemedicine networks, with a minimum of expense.

TI  - Development and deployment of a web-based physician order entry system.
PG  - 135-42
AB  - The computer-based Physician Order Entry System (POES) has been employed in many 
      clinical institutes in Taiwan. Most of the POES systems are developed in the
      two-tier client-server architecture, and a large portion of the systems are
      constructed on a mainframe or even a single PC. The exponential growth of the
      Internet has had a tremendous impact on our society in recent years. In
      consideration of the future user interface and system architecture, we have
      developed a three-tier web-based Physician Order Entry System and successfully
      deployed it in the Wang-Fang Hospital in Taipei. The system is the first POES
      based on three-tier and World Wide Web (WWW) in Taiwan. The system provides the
      Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan (SOAP) structure for the physician to
      enter subject, object, diagnoses, medicine dosage, treatment and laboratory test 
      request, and prints out the prescription and necessary document. The doctor can
      also retrieve the patient's medical record on the system. One of the special
      characteristics of the system is its personalized design. The doctor can define
      their own diagnosis, medicine and treatment database and any combination of these
      to facilitate their clinical work. The system has been reviewed since February
      1999. The result shows that the clinical procedure has become more efficient, and
      the chances of omission have been reduced. The system is very stable and the Open
      Database Connectivity (ODBC) database access did not show any delay in the
      network. Since we have incorporated many new web-programming techniques, the
      progress of the techniques will improve the system performance in the future.

TI  - A comparative study of feature-salience ranking techniques.
PG  - 1603-23
AB  - We assess the relative merits of a number of techniques designed to determine the
      relative salience of the elements of a feature set with respect to their ability 
      to predict a category outcome-for example, which features of a character
      contribute most to accurate character recognition. A number of different
      neural-net-based techniques have been proposed (by us and others) in addition to 
      a standard statistical technique, and we add a technique based on inductively
      generated decision trees. The salience of the features that compose a proposed
      set is an important problem to solve efficiently and effectively, not only for
      neural computing technology but also in order to provide a sound basis for any
      attempt to design an optimal computational system. The focus of this study is the
      efficiency and the effectiveness with which high-salience subsets of features can
      be identified in the context of ill-understood and potentially noisy real-world
      data. Our two simple approaches, weight clamping using a neural network and
      feature ranking using a decision tree, generally provide a good, consistent
      ordering of features. In addition, linear correlation often works well.

TI  - Using Bayesian networks in the construction of a bi-level multi-classifier. A
      case study using intensive care unit patients data.
PG  - 233-48
AB  - Combining the predictions of a set of classifiers has shown to be an effective
      way to create composite classifiers that are more accurate than any of the
      component classifiers. There are many methods for combining the predictions given
      by component classifiers. We introduce a new method that combine a number of
      component classifiers using a Bayesian network as a classifier system given the
      component classifiers predictions. Component classifiers are standard machine
      learning classification algorithms, and the Bayesian network structure is learned
      using a genetic algorithm that searches for the structure that maximises the
      classification accuracy given the predictions of the component classifiers.
      Experimental results have been obtained on a datafile of cases containing
      information about ICU patients at Canary Islands University Hospital. The
      accuracy obtained using the presented new approach statistically improve those
      obtained using standard machine learning methods.

TI  - Towards improvement of the accuracy and completeness of medication registration
      with the use of an electronic medical record (EMR).
PG  - 288-91
AB  - BACKGROUND: Approximately 80% of GPs use a GP information system (GIS) and an
      electronic medical record (EMR) in their daily practice. To reap the full
      benefits of an EMR for patient care, post-graduate education and research, the
      data input must be well structured and accurately coded. OBJECTIVES: The quality 
      and user-friendliness of the software positively influence the completeness and
      reliability of the data recorded in the GIS. To assess this in actual practice,
      this study examined whether or not an increase occurred in the accuracy and
      completeness of indication-related medication registration after the GIS's
      software package was upgraded. METHOD: GPs recorded data for the Registration
      Network Groningen (RNG) concerning four medication groups: insulin, trimethoprim,
      the contraceptive pill and beta-blocking agents. The completeness and accuracy of
      the registered data were assessed both before and after the change to the new
      software package. The completeness is evaluated on the basis of the indications
      missing for the prescribed medications. To assess accuracy, a check was made to
      determine whether the indications corresponded to those deemed relevant for that 
      particular medication according to National Pharmaceutical Guidelines. RESULTS:
      The percentage of missing indications decreased notably, especially in the
      chronically prescribed medication groups. For insulin, the percentage decreased
      from 40.5 to 3% and for the contraceptive pill from 34.5 to 1%. For trimethoprim,
      the percentage decreased from 10 to 1%, and for beta-blocking agents from 22 to
      1.5%. Of the indications present, the percentage of relevant indications showed a
      slight increase, with the largest increase observed for the contraceptive pill
      where the percentage rose from 86 to 96%. CONCLUSIONS: The completeness of
      recorded indications improved considerably after the change of software. This is 
      due mostly to the efforts of the GPs, their practice assistants and the support
      of the RNG organization involved in the conversion procedure. Accuracy improved
      slightly, especially due to the software modifications which ensured that
      non-existent codes could not be entered. To summarize, with increased
      user-friendliness of the software, combined with the training of motivated GPs,
      the quality of recorded data improved.

TI  - Anaesthesia alert: an integrated, networked, register of paediatric anaesthetic
      problems.
PG  - 113-6
AB  - The Paediatric Register of Anaesthetic Problems (PaedRAP) is a network-based
      anaesthesia hazard alert system. It is integrated with pre-anaesthesia
      consultations and patient questionnaires. All files, both electronic and on
      paper, are available 24 hours a day close to the operating theatres. This ensures
      that pertinent information is readily available when and where it is most needed.
      The PaedRAP is also linked to the automated theatre booking system to print
      warnings on the theatre lists. This minimizes the chance that important
      information goes unnoticed. Documentation of the progression of the various
      categories of patient problems and evolving management strategies has been useful
      both for individuals and groups.

TI  - Telehealth and the global health network in the 21st century. From homecare to

PG  - 155-67
AB  - The Information Era we live in has created new challenges and opportunities. This
      age of information highways has an economic price, which has not been properly
      evaluated. Detailed studies are needed to prove the cost and medical
      effectiveness of these technologies as well as its effects in the quality of
      life. Our society's future may depend on it. People are living longer,
      discoveries in genetics and in information technology are not only helping
      produce newer drugs faster but also providing the opportunity to exploit new
      areas such as disease prevention. These technologies provide a variety of
      opportunities to address public health challenges such as universal access for
      the uneducated, counter-bioterrorism, telemedicine, distance education, and home 
      care. These opportunities present new challenges such as: surveillance,
      privacy/confidentiality/security of personal information which will affect all of
      our lives. No strategy has been presented publicly (yet) addressing (neither) the
      benefits (n)or the pitfalls of such technologies. From an economic point of view 
      it is an imperative necessity to understand the importance of the Information
      Technology Infrastructure (ITI) and what it is. The investments in creating and
      maintaining this ITI will not come from a single application area such as
      healthcare, but rather from a combination of sources such as electronic commerce,
      banking, financial, manufacturing, entertainment, travelling, weather
      forecasting, pharmaceuticals, education, defence and many other 'industries' or
      application areas.

TI  - An infrastructure for Integrated Electronic Health Record services: the role of
      XML (Extensible Markup Language).
PG  - E7
AB  - BACKGROUND: The sharing of information resources is generally accepted as the key
      to substantial improvements in productivity and better quality of care. In
      addition, due to the greater mobility of the population, national and
      international healthcare networks are increasingly used to facilitate the sharing
      of healthcare-related information among the various actors of the field. In the
      context of HYGEIAnet, the regional health telematics network of Crete, an
      Integrated Electronic Health Record environment has been developed to provide
      integrated access to online clinical information, accessible throughout the
      island. OBJECTIVES: To make available comprehensive medical information about a
      patient by means of incorporating all the distributed and heterogeneous health
      record segments into an Integrated Electronic Health Record that can be viewed
      on-line through a unified user interface and visualization environment. METHODS: 
      The technological approach for implementing this Integrated Electronic Health
      Record environment is based on the HYGEIAnet Reference Architecture, which
      provides the necessary framework for the reuse of services, components, and
      interfaces. Seamless presentation of information is achieved by means of the
      Extensible Markup Language (XML), while its underlying capabilities allow for
      dynamic navigation according to personalized end-user preferences and
      authorities. RESULTS: The Integrated Electronic Health Record environment
      developed in HYGEIAnet provides the basis for consistent and authenticated access
      to primary information over the Internet in order to support decision-making.
      Primary information is always kept at the place where it has been produced, and
      is maintained by the most appropriate clinical information system, contrasting
      traditional store and forward techniques, or centralized clinical data
      repositories. CONCLUSIONS: Since documents are much more easily accessible rather
      than data inside a database, Extensible Markup Language has the potential of
      becoming a very cheap technology provided, of course, that the underlying
      Healthcare Information Infrastructure exists. XML can be introduced incrementally
      and its implementation is completely transparent to the end user.

TI  - The palm as a real-time wide-area data-access device.
PG  - 52-6
AB  - Handheld wireless technologies offer great promise in helping to improve
      healthcare. However, it is not clear whether off-the-shelf wireless networking
      will work as well within medical centers as this technology works outside of the 
      medical center. Therefore, we evaluated the coverage of wide-area wireless
      technology within two representative academic medical centers. The study
      determined the rate of connectivity by testing both the Palm VII and the Minstrel
      V modem in a set of locations typically frequented by house staff in their daily 
      activities. Within one hospital, connectivity was 59% for OmniSky service, and
      78% for Palm.net. The second hospital's connectivity was over 93% with both
      devices. Differences in connectivity were likely due to the number of rooms
      visited with externally exposed walls, the suburban versus urban location of the 
      academic medical center, and the relative location of service transponders. When 
      examined by the Johns Hopkins Clinical Devices Laboratory, both devices were
      found to operate without interfering with other hospital equipment.

TI  - TeleMedMail: free software to facilitate telemedicine in developing countries.
PG  - 815-9
AB  - Telemedicine offers the potential to alleviate the severe shortage of medical
      specialists in developing countries. However lack of equipment and poor network
      connections usually rule out video-conferencing systems. This paper describes a
      software application to facilitate store-and-forward telemedicine by email of
      images from digital cameras. TeleMedMail is written in Java and allows structured
      text entry, image processing, image and data compression, and data encryption.
      The design, implementation, and initial evaluation are described.

TI  - Dissemination of electronic patient records using primary care referrals as a
      vector for change.
PG  - 685-9
AB  - The Online Medical Record (OMR) is a full-featured shared electronic patient
      record in use since 1989 at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. The
      first practice to use the OMR was a primary care practice. We observed the
      pattern of voluntary adoption of the OMR and the referral patterns from primary
      care to specialists. Adoption of the OMR among specialists has accelerated in
      recent years, in many cases mirroring the referral patterns from primary care to 
      specialists. We hypothesize that referral of patients from primary care providers
      to specialists exposes these specialists to the benefits the electronic patient
      record and may promote the use of this technology. We conclude that these
      referral patterns provide a vector for the dissemination of electronic patient
      records. The important lesson is that EPR implementation in a health care network
      should begin with primary care to ensure the most efficient diffusion of this
      technology throughout the enterprise.

TI  - Web architecture for the remote browsing and analysis of distributed medical
      images and data.
PG  - 43-7
AB  - To provide easy retrieval, integration and evaluation of multimodal medical
      images and data in a web browser environment, distributed application
      technologies and Java programming were used to develop a client-server
      architecture based on software agents. The server side manages secure connections
      and queries to heterogeneous remote databases and file systems containing patient
      personal and clinical data. The client side is a Java applet running in a web
      browser and providing a friendly medical user interface to perform queries on
      patient and medical test data and integrate and visualize properly the various
      query results. A set of tools based on Java Advanced Imaging API enables to
      process and analyze the retrieved bioimages, and quantify their features in
      different regions of interest. The platform-independence Java technology makes
      the developed prototype easy to be managed in a centralized form and provided in 
      each site where an intranet or internet connection can be located. Giving the
      healthcare providers effective tools for browsing, querying, visualizing and
      evaluating comprehensively medical images and records in all locations where they
      can need them - e.g. emergency, operating theaters, ward, or even outpatient
      clinics- the implemented prototype represents an important aid in providing more 
      efficient diagnoses and medical treatments.

TI  - [Development of DICOM image viewing software for efficient image reading and
      evaluation of distributed server system for diagnostic environment].
PG  - 856-62
AB  - To construct an efficient diagnostic environment using computer displays, the
      author investigated the time of network transmission using clinical images. In
      our hospital, we introduced optical-fiber 100Base-Fx Ethernet connections between
      22 HIS-segments and one RIS-segment. Although Ethernet architecture is
      inexpensive, the speed of image transmission becomes 2371 KB/sec. (4.6
      CT-slice/sec.) in the RIS-segment and 996 KB/sec. (1.9 CT-slice/sec.) from the
      RIS-segment to HIS-segments. Because one examination is transmitted in one
      minute, it does not disturb image reading. Otherwise, a distributed server system
      using inexpensive personal computers helps in constructing an efficient system.
      This investigation showed that commercially based Digital Imaging and
      Communications in Medicine(DICOM) servers and RSNA Central Test Node servers are 
      not so different in transmission speed. The author programmed and developed DICOM
      transmission and viewing software for Macintosh computers. This viewer includes
      two inventions, dynamic tiling window system (DTWS) and window binding mode(WBM).
      On DTWS, windows, tiles, and images are independent objects, which are movable
      and resizable. The tile-matrix is changeable by mouse dragging, which realizes
      suitable tile rectangles for wide-low or narrow-high images. The arranging window
      tool prevents windows from scattering. Using WBM, any operation affects each
      window similarly. This means that the relationship of compared images is always
      equivalent. DTWS and WBM contribute greatly to a filmless diagnostic environment.

TI  - [Can we rely on electronic reporting of laboratory results?].
PG  - 2300-2
AB  - BACKGROUND: Electronic result reporting from two laboratories to physicians in
      primary health care through electronic data interchange (EDI) has been used as a 
      supplement to the printed reports. The aim of the study was to see if the quality
      of the electronic reporting could be improved so that the printed reporting could
      be cut out without any loss of data. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Staff members in 20
      selected offices were interviewed and error messages on file in the computer
      systems were studied. RESULTS: During a period of four months, the laboratories
      sent 10,740 electronic messages to the selected offices. Error messages arose
      from 71 of these messages (0.7%). 49 of the errors were discovered and corrected 
      by the staff, but 22 errors were not noticed, and the result reports were lost.
      INTERPRETATION: If electronic result reporting should become the only reporting
      routine, it would be necessary to change several routines both in the
      laboratories and in the physician's offices. Patients must be identified by using
      official identifiers. The physicians must control in the computer system that all
      requested results are received, and the programs used for controlling the
      messages before they are entered into the electronic patient journal, must be
      improved.

TI  - Data mining techniques applied to medical information.
PG  - 81-102
AB  - Knowledge discovery from the dramatically increased data of an auto-stored
      medical information system is still in its infancy. The purpose of this study is 
      to use widely available and easily operated techniques that can satisfy general
      users in extracting specific knowledge to make the medical information system
      more functional. Data mining techniques, including data visualisation,
      correlation analysis, discriminant analysis, and neural networks supervised
      classification, were applied to heart disease databases. These techniques can
      help to identify high risk patients, define the most important factors
      (variables) in heart disease, and build a multivariate relationship model to show
      the relationship between any two variables in a way that such relationships are
      easy to view. Simple visualization techniques were utilised to construct this
      model, which corresponds with current medical knowledge. Two nonparametric
      (distribution assumption free) classification tools were employed to identify
      high risk heart disease patients. Both the neural networks supervised
      classification methods and the discriminant analysis method produced reliable
      classification rates for heart disease patients. However, neural networks yielded
      a higher percentage of correct classifications (averaging 89%) than discriminant 
      analysis (79%). Data visualisation and correlation analysis resulted in similar
      conclusions regarding the most important factors in heart disease. These data
      mining tools provide simple and effective methods of extracting knowledge from
      general medical information. The treatment of missing data is also discussed.

AB  - This paper deals with the integration of a powerful parallel computer-based image
      analysis and visualization system for cardiology into a hospital information
      system. Further services are remote access to the hospital Web server through an 
      internet network. The visualization system includes dynamic three-dimensional
      representation of two types of medical images (e.g., magnetic resonance and
      nuclear medicine) as well as two images in the same modality (e.g., basal versus 
      stress images). A series of software tools for quantitative image analysis
      developed for supporting diagnosis of cardiac disease are also available,
      including automated image segmentation and quantitative time evaluation of left
      ventricular volumes and related indices during cardiac cycle, myocardial mass,
      and myocardial perfusion indices. The system has been tested both at a
      specialized cardiologic center and for remote consultation in diagnosis of
      cardiac disease by using anatomical and perfusion magnetic resonance images.

AB  - Despite the emphasis of primary care on preventive services over the past decade,
      and the reminder systems that are available to promote the provision of these
      services, many patients still do not receive needed services. This study
      describes the preventive services that the primary care practices of the Practice
      Partner Research Network (PPRNet) monitors, and documents adherence to them.
      Preventive services monitored in PPRNet practices and the levels of adherence to 
      them vary by practice and service. The lower-than-desired levels of adherence
      offer opportunities for improvement interventions.

TI  - Infrared transmission of electronic information via LAN in the operating room.
PG  - 171-5
AB  - Recent advances in technology have brought many kinds of monitoring devices into 
      the operating room (OR). The information gathered by monitors can be channeled to
      the operating ward information system via a local area network (LAN). Connecting 
      patients to monitors and monitors to the LAN, however, requires a large number of
      cables. This wiring is generally inconvenient and particularly troublesome if the
      layout of the OR is rearranged. From this point of view, wireless transmission
      seems ideally suited to clinical settings. Currently, two modes of wireless
      connectivity are available: radio-frequency (RF) waves or infrared (IR) waves.
      Some reports suggest that RF transmission is likely to cause electromagnetic
      interference (EMI) in medical devices such as cardiac pacemakers or infusion
      pumps. The risk of malfunctioning life-sustaining devices and the catastrophic
      consequences this would have on seriously ill patients rules out the use of RF.
      Here, we report an IR system using IR modems for LAN connectivity in the OR. In
      this study, we focused on the possible detrimental effects of EMI during wireless
      connectivity. In our trial, we found no evidence of EMI of IR modems with any of 
      the medical devices we tested. Furthermore, IR modems showed similar performance 
      to a wired system even in an electrically noisy environment. We conclude that IR 
      wireless connectivity can be safely and effectively used in ORs.

TI  - Depression diagnoses and antidepressant use in primary care practices: a study
      from the Practice Partner Research Network (PPRNet).
PG  - 68-72
AB  - BACKGROUND: We examined the pharmacologic management and follow-up of adults with
      newly diagnosed depression, and the use of antidepressants among patients not
      diagnosed with depression in primary care practice. A total of 389 physicians in 
      39 practices in the Practice Partner Research Network (PPRNet), a national
      network of primary care physicians provided data for the study. METHODS: We
      performed a retrospective cohort study for the year 1996 using demographic,
      contact, diagnosis, and prescription data available in the December 1997 PPRNet
      database. We identified patients with new diagnoses of depression from the
      problem lists in the electronic medical record. Psychopharmacologic agents
      prescribed within 5 days of the diagnosis, follow-up contacts within 6 months of 
      the diagnosis, and diagnoses of patients prescribed antidepressants without a new
      diagnosis of depression were also identified. We performed descriptive analyses
      for all practices and for individual practices. RESULTS: During 1996, there were 
      149,327 active adult patients in the 39 participating practices. Of the 131,141
      patients without a history of depression or antidepressant prescription, 2103
      (1.6%) had a new diagnosis of depression in 1996. Incidence among the 39
      practices ranged from 0.4% to 4.0%. Forty-nine percent of the newly diagnosed
      patients received an antidepressant prescription within 5 days of diagnosis; 81% 
      of the prescriptions were for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Ninety
      percent of the patients prescribed antidepressants had at least one contact in
      the 6 months after diagnosis (mean = 5.3 contacts). One third of the patients who
      had not begun antidepressants within 5 days of their diagnoses started taking one
      by the end of 1996. Among the 149,327 active patients, 6.3% received a
      prescription for an antidepressant in 1996. More than 40% of these patients had
      never been diagnosed with depression. CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights the high 
      prevalence and wide interpractice variations of diagnosing depression and
      prescribing antidepressants in primary care. Follow-up of patients newly
      diagnosed with depression was common and consistent with published guidelines.
      Opportunities for increased detection and treatment of depression exist in
      approximately half of the study practices.

TI  - An XML-Java system for HL7-based healthcare informatics.
PG  - 1051-5
AB  - Health-Level (HL) 7 message semantics allows effective functional implementation 
      of Electronic Medical Record (EMR)--encompassing both clinical and administrative
      (i.e. demographic and financial) information--interchange systems, at the expense
      of complexity with respect the Protocol Data Unit (PDU) structure and the
      client-side application architecture. In this paper we feature the usage of the
      Extensible Markup Language (XML) document-object modelling and Java client-server
      connectivity towards the implementation of a Web-based system for EMR transaction
      processing. Our solution features an XML-based description of EMR templates,
      which are subsequently transcribed into a Hypertext Markup Language
      (HTML)-Javascript form. This allows client-side user interfaceability and
      server-side functionality--i.e. message validation, authentication and database
      connectivity--to be handled through standard Web client-server mechanisms, the
      primary assumption being availability of a browser capable of XML documents and
      the associated stylesheets. We assume usage of the Internet as the interchange
      medium, hence the necessity for authentication and data privacy mechanisms, both 
      of which can be constructed using standard Java-based building blocks.

TI  - Radiological tele-immersion for next generation networks.
PG  - 4-9
AB  - Since the acquisition of high-resolution three-dimensional patient images has
      become widespread, medical volumetric datasets (CT or MR) larger than 100 MB and 
      encompassing more than 250 slices are common. It is important to make this
      patient-specific data quickly available and usable to many specialists at
      different geographical sites. Web-based systems have been developed to provide
      volume or surface rendering of medical data over networks with low fidelity, but 
      these cannot adequately handle stereoscopic visualization or huge datasets.
      State-of-the-art virtual reality techniques and high speed networks have made it 
      possible to create an environment for clinicians geographically distributed to
      immersively share these massive datasets in real-time. An object-oriented method 
      for instantaneously importing medical volumetric data into Tele-Immersive
      environments has been developed at the Virtual Reality in Medicine Laboratory
      (VRMedLab) at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). This networked-VR
      setup is based on LIMBO, an application framework or template that provides the
      basic capabilities of Tele-Immersion. We have developed a modular general purpose
      Tele-Immersion program that automatically combines 3D medical data with the
      methods for handling the data. For this purpose a DICOM loader for IRIS Performer
      has been developed. The loader was designed for SGI machines as a shared object, 
      which is executed at LIMBO's runtime. The loader loads not only the selected
      DICOM dataset, but also methods for rendering, handling, and interacting with the
      data, bringing networked, real-time, stereoscopic interaction with radiological
      data to reality. Collaborative, interactive methods currently implemented in the 
      loader include cutting planes and windowing. The Tele-Immersive environment has
      been tested on the UIC campus over an ATM network. We tested the environment with
      3 nodes; one ImmersaDesk at the VRMedLab, one CAVE at the Electronic
      Visualization Laboratory (EVL) on east campus, and a CT scan machine in UIC
      Hospital. CT data was pulled directly from the scan machine to the Tele-Immersion
      server in our Laboratory, and then the data was synchronously distributed by our 
      Onyx2 Rack server to all the VR setups. Instead of permitting medical volume
      visualization at one VR device, by combining teleconferencing, tele-presence, and
      virtual reality, the Tele-Immersive environment will enable geographically
      distributed clinicians to intuitively interact with the same medical volumetric
      models, point, gesture, converse, and see each other. This environment will bring
      together clinicians at different geographic locations to participate in
      Tele-Immersive consultation and collaboration.

AB  - It looks that networking welfare thinking and implementations of network projects
      only follow the development of data transfer possibilities. It is a danger that
      seamless chain of care in health care is just a data transferring generator based
      on easy connections, only creating needs for new data transferring. This is an
      'illusion of core skills' that does not extend to the development of the contents
      of services. Easy access to the system makes more contacts and need for more also
      clinical services. New needs for data transfer burden the personnel with
      unnecessary information and networking functional model does not emancipate them 
      to use their substantial skills. It means more costs and it is also a danger that
      normal life will be medicated. Public sector cannot finance all these new
      possibilities and consequences of modern technology. Does all this create a new
      combination of public and private sector and push them to allocate
      responsibilities in developing work? If the public and private sectors do not
      find the balance in controlling this development, also actors outside health care
      get to influence the choices and health care loses its autonomy. It becomes a
      business means for companies producing data transfer and network services. From
      the prioritization point of view this is not a good vision for financing and
      delivery of health care services either in public or private sector.

TI  - Impact of medical informatics on medical education.
PG  - 764-6
AB  - In recent years, medical informatics has become a well-recognized branch of
      medicine. It is a multidisciplinary science that combines information technology 
      and various specialties of medicine. The impact of medical informatics on medical
      education is advancing along with the rapid developments in computer science.
      Departments of medical informatics or similar divisions have appeared in schools 
      of medicine in Taiwan in the past 5 years. At National Taiwan University College 
      of Medicine, we offer curricula in basic computer concepts, network concepts,
      operating systems, word processing, database and data processing, computer media 
      resources, multimedia computer statistics, intelligent health information
      systems, medical diagnostic support systems, and electronic medical record
      systems. Distance learning has also been favorably accepted on this campus.
      Recently, we proposed the concept of a virtual medical campus, which will break
      the physical barriers of time and space. We expect this revolution to influence
      every aspect of medicine, especially medical education.

PG  - 194-9
AB  - Two World Health Organization Radiation Medical Emergency Preparedness and
      Assistance Network centers have constructed a standardized central repository of 
      acute radiation syndrome case histories. The case histories are stored on a
      database server. Radiation protection centers can remotely access the database by
      user-friendly client software over the Internet. Physicians can use the medical
      information system to retrieve similar case histories for decision support, to
      improve their medical knowledge by inspecting real case histories, and for
      research on the acute radiation syndrome. The system architecture is presented
      and it is shown in detail how the information system can be employed to deliver
      medical decision support. Dialogue-response times over narrow-bandwidth Internet 
      connections are better than when using conventional World-Wide-Web technology.
      However, the latter does not require the installation of client software other
      than a browser. A Java applet as client could combine the advantages of the two
      approaches.

TI  - Design elements for a computerized patient record.
PG  - 187-93
AB  - Computerized medical record systems have to present user- and problem-oriented
      views of a patient record to health-care professionals. Presentation and
      manipulation of data must be easily adaptable to current and future demands of
      medical specialties and specific settings. During the definition, development and
      evaluation of a prototype of a computerized patient record system, design
      elements were elaborated to support physicians and other health-care
      professionals. Our approach shows a high degree of flexibility and adaptability
      to specific needs, problem orientation and connectivity to other systems, via a
      hospital information network. The explicit description of the contents of a
      patient record allows to augment the number of items that can be recorded without
      modifying the data structure. New views on patient data can be added to the
      system without interfering with the routine use of the system. Application in
      several medical specialties proved the feasibility of our prototype.

      of ambulatory, mostly primary care practices that use the Practice Partner
      Patient Records electronic medical records. Participating practices send
      anonymous clinical data on patients to the PPRNet data center monthly. Standard
      database management and statistical software are used to compile practice
      reports. These reports include measures of adherence to process and outcome
      measures for chronic illnesses, the subject of this report. RESULTS: Forty-eight 
      PPRNet practices provided data for the first quarter of 1998. A total of 336,401 
      patients were active in these practices during this quarter. At least 2000 active
      patients had each of the conditions studied. Wide variation in guideline
      adherence among PPRNet practices was present for each of the performance
      measures. Better performance was present for physical examination measures and
      laboratory monitoring than for treatment interventions. Overall performance was
      excellent for blood pressure monitoring, poor for lipid monitoring in patients
      with CHD, and intermediate for glycosylated hemoglobin monitoring in patients
      with diabetes mellitus. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study are comparable to 
      others in documenting that most clinical practice guidelines for chronic illness 
      are not followed for a majority of patients and that large majorities do not
      reach desired clinical outcomes.

TI  - Information systems integration in radiology.
PG  - 218-22
AB  - Advances in information systems and technology in conjunction with outside forces
      requiring improved reporting are driving sweeping changes in the practice of
      radiology. In most academic radiology departments, there can be at least five
      separate information systems in daily use, a clinical picture archiving and
      communication system (PACS), a hospital information system (HIS), a radiology
      information system (RIS), a voice-recognition dictation system, and an electronic
      teaching/research file system. A PACS will have incomplete, incorrect, and
      inconsistent data if manual data entry is used. Correct routing of studies for
      diagnostic reporting and clinical review requires accurate information about the 
      study type and the referring physician or service, often not easily entered
      manually. An HIS is a hospital-wide information system used to access patient
      information, reports from various services, and billing information. The RIS is
      typically a system specifically designed to place radiology orders, to receive
      interpretations, and to prepare bills for patients. Voice-recognition systems
      automatically transcribe the radiologist's dictation, eliminating transcription
      delays. Another system that is needed in a teaching hospital holds images and
      data for research and education. Integration of diverse systems must be performed
      to provide the functionality required by an electronic radiology department and
      the services it supports. Health Level 7 (HL7) and Digital Imaging and
      Communications in Medicine (DICOM) have enabled sharing of data among systems and
      can be used as the building blocks for truly integrated systems, but the user
      community and manufacturers need to specify the types of functionality needed to 
      build clinically useful systems. Although technology development has produced the
      tools for interoperability for clinical and research/educational use, more work
      needs to be done to define the types of interaction that needs to be performed to
      realize the potential of these systems.

TI  - Patient-borne memory device facilitates "point of care" data access.
PG  - 60-3
AB  - Although electronic medical records and a central database have made accurate and
      consistent patient medical information more readily available than with the
      traditional patient chart, there are many locations in healthcare facilities
      where terminals for accessing patient data are not available. As patient care
      becomes decentralized and more patients require anesthesia outside of the
      operating suites, routing a network-based system to all these locations can be
      expensive and time consuming. We designed a system whereby essential patient data
      of interest to anesthesiologists is stored on an electronic memory device the
      size of a watch battery attached to the patient's wristband. Accessing and
      editing the data is done via a hand-held computer. This system provides secure
      patient data storage and management at the "point of care." At the conclusion of 
      the patient's anesthesia-related care, the data is downloaded to a relational
      database for use in outcome analysis, billing, and quality assurance. After
      collecting preoperative evaluations, intraoperative data, and postoperative data 
      on 560 patients anesthetized for surgery or other procedures, we find this system
      to be a reliable, low-cost, medical information management system, with possible 
      application to other medical specialties.

TI  - Better by half: hypertension in the elderly and the 'rule of halves': a primary
      care audit of the clinical computer record as a springboard to improving care.
PG  - 123-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite recent studies highlighting the benefits of treating elderly 
      hypertensives, researchers have shown that the taking on board of these findings 
      has been disappointing in primary care, where the 'rule of halves' still applies.
      Clinical computers could help performance in this area, yet national and local
      research suggests that they are under-used. OBJECTIVE: Our aim is to develop a
      pragmatic intervention which aims to: improve patient care by translating
      research findings into practice, increase meaningful computer use, establish
      'paperless' annual audits and improve 'networking' between practices. METHOD:
      Following a baseline audit to ascertain accuracy, the computer records of
      participating practices were tested against the 'rule of halves' for
      hypertension. Results were presented to each practice (individual practice and
      aggregate data for all practices). Management guidelines, standardization of
      computer recording, achievable targets and review dates were agreed. The study
      was conducted in West London practices using the EMIS computer system in
      1996/1997. RESULTS: An 81% (22/27) practice response rate was achieved. Baseline 
      audit was completed for 22 practices. Fifteen practices appear to be using their 
      computer regularly (two-thirds). Using strict definitions, 'the rule of halves'
      still applies. Using looser definitions, three-quarters of hypertensives are
      known, two-thirds are treated and just under two-thirds are controlled. This
      project identified wide inter- and intra-practice variation in: use of the
      computer, patient follow-up, attainment of target BP, rounding BP readings to
      target levels and prescribing patterns. CONCLUSION: This focused training
      intervention has introduced practices to evidence-based proactive care and
      highlighted an important application for clinical computers. A local network of
      practices has been established for future projects. For elderly patients
      registered with a GP, the rule of halves has been improved upon, provided that a 
      figure of 160/90 is taken as an adequate control. Attainment of target BP in
      treated hypertensives was similar to that reported from large trials. There is
      enormous scope for improving identification and follow-up of hypertensives using 
      clinical computers and systematic models of care. The wide inter-practice
      variation in hypertension management requires further study.

TI  - Using information systems to measure and improve quality.
PG  - 115-24
AB  - Information systems (IS) are increasingly important for measuring and improving
      quality. In this paper, we describe our integrated delivery system's plan for and
      experiences with measuring and improving quality using IS. Our belief is that for
      quality measurement to be practical, it must be integrated with the routine
      provision of care and whenever possible should be done using IS. Thus, at one
      hospital, we now perform almost all quality measurement using IS. We are also
      building a clinical data warehouse, which will serve as a repository for quality 
      information across the network. However, IS are not only useful for measuring
      care, but also represent powerful tools for improving care using decision
      support. Specific areas in which we have already seen significant benefit include
      reducing the unnecessary use of laboratory testing, reporting important
      abnormalities to key providers rapidly, prevention and detection of adverse drug 
      events, initiatives to change prescribing patterns to reduce drug costs and
      making critical pathways available to providers. Our next major effort will be
      introduce computerized guidelines on a more widespread basis, which will be
      challenging. However, the advent of managed care in the US has produced strong
      incentives to provide high quality care at low cost and our perspective is that
      only with better IS than exist today will this be possible without compromising
      quality. Such systems make feasible implementation of quality measurement, care
      improvement and cost reduction initiatives on a scale which could not previously 
      be considered.

TI  - Quality of HMO vaccination databases used to monitor childhood vaccine safety.
      Vaccine Safety DataLink Team.
PG  - 186-94
AB  - The availability of large, population-based, automated, medical care databases
      provides unique opportunities for monitoring the safety of childhood vaccines.
      The authors assessed the quality of automated vaccination databases by comparing 
      them with vaccinations documented in paper-based medical records at three large
      US West Coast health maintenance organizations (HMOs) participating in the
      Vaccine Safety DataLink (VSD) study, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
      collaborative study of childhood vaccine safety. The authors randomly selected 1%
      or 2% samples of VSD study populations (n = 1,224-2,577) for data quality
      analyses. Agreement between automated and abstracted vaccinations required
      identical triads of child identification number, vaccination date, and vaccine
      type. Separate analyses were conducted for each HMO and for each vaccine type
      administered between 1991 and 1995. Agreement was measured by three matching
      proportions: 1) the proportion of automated vaccinations present in the
      abstracted source, 2) the proportion of abstracted vaccinations present in the
      automated source, and 3) the proportion of vaccinations from either source
      present in both sources. Overall, for common childhood vaccines, proportion 1
      ranged from 83% to 99%, proportion 2 ranged from 82% to 98%, and proportion 3
      ranged from 70% to 97%. Lack of automated data was the most frequent type of
      discrepancy, followed by date mismatches and vaccine type mismatches. Vaccination
      exposure classification errors in the range reported here were found by
      mathematical modeling to only modestly bias measured medical outcome rate ratios 
      toward the null hypothesis. The results of the data quality analyses support the 
      usefulness of vaccination exposure data derived from these automated HMO
      vaccination databases.

      patient-related information with anyone in the group, or with the related
      ophthalmologic, internal, resp. scientific centers at the TU Munich and the GSF
      Neuherberg. Connections are routinely performed in the asynchronous or in the
      synchronous mode, and all partners participate in the scientific projects
      Knowledge Based Information System, Glaucoma Monitor, and Diabetic Retinopathy
      Monitor--as well as in the enhancement of a trustful patient-physician
      relationship ("second opinion") and a closer cooperation in out-patient and
      in-patient ophthalmical surgery and medical treatment.

AB  - The CEN TC 251 Electronic Health Care Record Architecture is the first part of a 
      four part communication prestandard intended to facilitate the safe communication
      of clinical information, irrespective of circumstances related to time, distance,
      and responsibility. The work has important implications for a diversity of
      stakeholders and must embody clinical principles if it is to succeed. The issue
      at hand is how to enable clinicians to validate the reference architecture, which
      is necessarily a technical document, so that they have confidence that it can
      meet the clinical requirement for safe communication. A model of communication
      that has been used to ground the architecture is shown to be useful in creating
      relevant clinical scenarios to permit the first steps towards coherent validation
      in a systematic way.

TI  - Java-based framework for the secure distribution of electronic medical records.
PG  - 582-7
AB  - In this paper, we present a Java-based framework for the processing, storage and 
      delivery of Electronic Medical Records (EMR). The choice of Java as a
      developmental and operational environment ensures operability over a wide-range
      of client-side platforms, with our on-going work emphasising migration towards
      Extensible Markup Language (XML) capable Web browser clients. Telemedicine in
      support of womb-to-tomb healthcare as articulated by the Multimedia Supercorridor
      (MSC) Telemedicine initiative--which motivated this project--will require
      high-volume data exchange over an insecure public-access Wide Area Network (WAN),
      thereby requiring a hybrid cryptosystem with both symmetric and asymmetric
      components. Our prototype framework features a pre-transaction authentication and
      key negotiation sequence which can be readily modified for client-side
      environments ranging from Web browsers without local storage capability to
      workstations with serial connectivity to a tamper-proof device, and also for
      point-to-multipoint transaction processes.

TI  - Telemedicine in the Malaysian Multimedia Super Corridor: towards personalized
      lifetime health plans.
PG  - 283-8
AB  - The Malaysian Telemedicine initiative advocates a paradigm shift in healthcare
      delivery patterns by way of implementing a person-centred and wellness-focused
      healthcare system. This paper introduces the Malaysian Telemedicine vision, its
      functionality and associated operational conditions. In particular, we focus on
      the conceptualisation of one key Telemedicine component i.e. the Lifetime Health 
      Plan (LHP) system--a distributed multimodule application for the periodic
      monitoring and generation of health-care advisories for all Malaysians. In line
      with the LHP project, we present an innovative healthcare delivery
      info-structure--LifePlan--that aims to provide life-long, pro-active,
      personalised, wellness-oriented healthcare services to assist individuals to
      manage and interpret their health needs. Functionally, LifePlan based healthcare 
      services are delivered over the WWW, packaged as Personalised Lifetime Health
      Plans that allow individuals to both monitor their health status and to guide
      them in healthcare planning.

TI  - Digital networking and archiving with ACOM T.O.P.
PG  - 323-7
AB  - The international DICOM 3 standard for a single patient record exchange media
      (CD-R) provided the necessary definition for digital recording and distribution
      of cardiac angiographic patient data. The medical industry developed archive and 
      review stations that allow the replacement of the 35 mm cine film. SIEMENS
      launched ACOM. T.O.P. in late 1995. The benefits and technical solution are
      presented in this paper. Today, the solution for networked real-time image data
      distribution within the hospital has become reality. Further integration of
      hemodynamic data, connectivity of hospital information systems, easy access and
      distribution of such high volume data from and to remote locations is well under 
      way. ACOM. net is used as an example for the realization of commercial products
      to fulfill the demands of cardiologist and hospital administrators.

TI  - Internet and healthcare in Brazil: the role of the Working Group for Healthcare
      (GT Saude).
PG  - 519-29
AB  - This paper introduces the GT Saude initiative in Brazil. The group is part of the
      Brazilian Internet project, which goals are to depict how Internet can be useful 
      to the society. The mission of the GT Saude group is to foster Internet
      applications on the healthcare area. The main projects currently under
      development are presented: Multicom-21, using large bandwidth connections on
      telemedicine; the Unified Health Record, using Internet and smart-cards for a
      national minimum patient data set; the Brazilian Virtual Hospital, that presents 
      a large amount of useful information and links for healthcare professionals and
      people in general; the National Healthcare Information Network (RNIS), that uses 
      Internet as a medium for data exchange among the state secretaries and publishing
      statistics from the national healthcare system (SUS) for general public access;
      and finally the virtual university proposal, which uses Internet for education
      and is offering its first course on nutrition. The heterogeneity of the projects 
      is meant and is part of the group's task, which is to cover the subject as widely
      as possible. Through this 'demonstration' projects the group is trying to prove
      the usefulness and benefits of using Internet technologies, even (or mainly) on a
      developing country with an inadequate healthcare situation. In its short
      existence the GT Saude group has achieved several of its original goals. The most
      relevant accomplishments are: putting together different groups, eliciting
      synergy across the projects and encompassing a broad spectrum of applications
      (the 'demonstration factor').

TI  - A scientific relational database combined with a report generator for endoscopy
      in networks: EndoNet.
PG  - 610-6
AB  - BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: The flexibility required in academic endoscopy units
      is not provided by the available database systems. In a project involving
      substantial cooperation between endoscopists and computer scientists, we have
      developed an adaptable database, combined with a report generator embedded in the
      hospital's intranet. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Six workstations in different areas of
      the hospital were clustered with a UNIX operating system to implement multi-user 
      capability and access control. A relational database was used to design an
      application appropriate to the specific needs of the endoscopy unit in a teaching
      hospital engaged in scientific research. Both the terminology used in
      standardized endoscopy nomenclature and a free text block facility were included.
      A graphical user interface was developed to assemble pertinent data, generate the
      reports, and supervise the database. RESULTS: A total of 4936 examinations
      including 2988 patients were entered consecutively during continuous routine
      operation of the system. Complete report generation required five minutes
      (median; range 1-9 minutes). Both structured items and free text were used in all
      the reports. Querying of the database was possible, concerning matters such as
      the need for repeated endoscopic therapy in acute gastrointestinal bleeding (4%),
      the search for Helicobacter pylori in appropriate patients (64%), the rate of
      accidental pancreatic duct visualization in endoscopic retrograde cholangiography
      (24%), and links between examinations and active trials (2%). Indicating improved
      report quality, the number and the diameter of esophageal varices in patients
      with varices were more frequently reported with the new report system than with
      previous typed reports (P<0.001). An anonymous questionnaire revealed that the
      readability of the computer-generated reports was better than that of the
      previous typewritten reports (P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This report describes the
      creation of a database application and a report generator meeting the needs of
      scientific and routine use, and the successful application of this system in an
      academic endoscopy unit.

TI  - Using a WWW-based mail user agent for secure electronic mail service for health
      care users.
PG  - 247-53
AB  - WWW-based user interface is presented for secure electronic mail service for
      healthcare users. Using this method, communications between an electronic mail
      (WWW) server and users (WWW browsers) can be performed securely using Secure
      Socket Layer protocol-based Hypertext Transfer Protocol (SSL-HTTP). The mail can 
      be encrypted, signed, and sent to the recipients and vice versa on the remote WWW
      server. The merit of this method is that many healthcare users can use a secure
      electronic mail system easily and immediately, because SSL-compatible WWW
      browsers are widely used and this system can be made available simply by
      installing a WWW-based mail user agent on a mail server. We implemented a
      WWW-based mail user agent which is compatible with PEM-based secure mail and made
      it available to about 16,000 healthcare users. We believe this approach is
      effective in facilitating secure network-based information exchange among medical
      professionals.

TI  - Implementation of multi-vendor DICOM standard image transfer in hospital wide ATM
      network.
PG  - 85-9
AB  - At Hamamatsu University Hospital, an ATM + FDDI network was installed in January 
      1995, when the hospital information system was upgraded. With its unique 'wheel' 
      shape configuration, FDDI automatically backs up in case of an ATM switch
      failure. The authors implemented a DICOM image database server and DICOM viewer
      in the Hamamatsu University Hospital ATM + FDDI network. The DICOM standard
      worked well between different vendor products. In sending 512 x 512, 2 byte CT
      images, 40% of the transfer time was spent for the network data transfer, which
      is 70% of the theoretical value of 10 Mb peripheral transfer rate. Meanwhile, ATM
      load factor increased less than 0.5%. As we have a very fast data transfer
      network, we must check display speed, hard disc access time, PC bus speed, and
      display software, in order to enjoy the high speed network transfer fully. The
      sequence of image transmission within a study is not stated in the DICOM document
      and is depending on the server. Therefore, there should be an agreement between
      server and clients, still more than DICOM, in order to make better PACS.

TI  - Clinician usage patterns of a desktop radiology information display application.
PG  - 137-41
AB  - We developed a system for delivering radiologic images and reports to desktop
      computers used for the electronic medical record (EMR). This system was used by
      both primary care physicians and specialists primarily in the out-patient
      setting. The system records all physician interactions with the application to a 
      database. This usage information was then studied in order to understand the
      value and requirements of an application that could display radiology information
      (reports and images) on EMR workstations. In this report we describe some of the 
      differences and similarities in usage patterns for the two physician groups. A
      very high percentage of physicians indicated that having image display
      capabilities on the workstations was very valuable.

      Obstetrics and Gynecology sentinel network for maternity hospitals. II. Changes
      in practices and results. 1994-1997].
PG  - 375-83
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The observation of medical practices and the analysis of outcome as a 
      function of practices are essential today for monitoring and improvement of the
      healthcare system. The AUDIPOG Sentinel Network provides a tool for the
      self-assessment of practices that enables each unit to assess its position
      relative to a group of maternity wards. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Pooling of
      individual data about births that occurred during the month of January each year 
      in about a hundred volunteer wards allows assessing perinatal health indicators
      and following their evolution over time. A sample rectification technique,
      adapted from the quota method, allows offsetting the methodological problems
      created by volunteering and assessing perinatal indicators at the national level.
      RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The analysis of data collected from 1994 to 1997
      indicates a number of trends, even in the short run, and justifies that a real
      practice monitoring and assessment tool be set up in order to improve perinatal
      health.

TI  - Automated scheduling of radiologic procedures.
PG  - 310-22
AB  - The dramatic advances in radiology have increased the number and type of machines
      and of daily performed exams. Consequently, workload and management organization 
      problems have also markedly increased. Automated, computerized scheduling of
      radiologic exams is certainly a step forward in a modern rational management of a
      Diagnostic Imaging service: the relationship with the patient is improved with
      the optimization of care delivered and of the radiologist's work, who with the
      new technology is able to rapidly consult the previous exams as well as the list 
      of exams to be performed. The advances in health care information technology
      imply communications at a distance. From each ward of the hospital, requests for 
      radiologic exams can be automatically scheduled or kept on a dynamic waiting list
      for automated input in future work shifts. Via the same system, reports (and also
      radiologic images) can by rapidly transmitted to the wards. At the "Universita
      Cattolica del S. Cuore" from several years, an integrated information system has 
      been implemented for management of patient data, exams and care delivered.
      Radiology represents one of major departmental systems of the network for the
      number of machines installed and the amount of information supplied. The system
      will be soon able to store images from all digital and nondigital machines, and
      visualize on dedicated workstations the images of ongoing exams or stored
      previous ones.

TI  - Aspects of implementing and harmonizing healthcare communication standards.
PG  - 163-71
AB  - A variety of healthcare communication standards (HCS) have been developed during 
      the last decade. They have improved the interoperability and the connectivity in 
      open hospital information systems to a large extent. They have also reduced time 
      and efforts during the implementation of standard interfaces. However, the
      implementation of communication standards is still far from the expected plug and
      play. The two reasons which are the main cause the current drawbacks are
      identified--the lack of a standardized terminology and the restricted flexibility
      of the currently used interchange formats. On the one hand the standardization of
      the terminology can not be solved by the standards development organizations. It 
      is a general challenge for the medical informatics community. On the other hand
      the movement to a new interchange format can be initiated by standards
      development organizations. The application of SGML/XML as an interchange format
      for communication standards offers a much greater flexibility and adaptability to
      user needs than the currently used interchange formats. Concepts for a smooth
      change to a new direction are discussed.

TI  - A web interface for multimedia electronic patient record: consensual validation
      of the Aquitaine Health Information Network prototypes.
PG  - 75-84
AB  - The PromptPR patient record originates from the research and development project 
      DILEMMA (1992-94) and has been undertaken in the context of the research project 
      PROMPT (4th Framework Health Telematics). Here we present the work undertaken
      with the doctors of the project RISA (Reseau d'Information de Sante en Aquitaine)
      in order to adapt the patient record to their various practical medical
      conditions. Effectively, there are implications for general practitioners, the
      private sector and hospital personnel. The richness of the workgroup and the
      adoption of a participative methodology, guided by the demands of the end-users
      allowed the creation of an electronic patient record (EPR) sufficiently simple
      and generic as to serve as a common base for both general practitioners and
      hospital medical staff. Independent of this system, the multimedia interface
      presented is based on frames, which enables visualization of the EPR either
      vertically or horizontally, with access to both the multimedia and external
      documentation of the patient. This web interface is the result of a consensus of 
      opinion within the group.

TI  - Expert system support using Bayesian belief networks in the prognosis of
      head-injured patients of the ICU.
PG  - 1-18
AB  - The present study concerns the construction and operation of a Bayesian
      analytical system, namely a Bayesian belief network (BBN) for the prognosis at 24
      h of head-injured patients of the intensive care unit. The construction of a BBN 
      incorporates the maintenance of a large database including all the critical
      variables corresponding to the specific clinical domain. This database is
      processed to provide the necessary libraries of conditional probability values.
      BBNs permit the combination of prognostic evidence in a cumulative manner and
      provide a quantitative measure of certainty in the final decision. The user views
      the changes at each step, thus being capable of deciding upon the necessary
      pieces of information in order to reach a certain belief threshold. The system
      produces results that are compatible with the opinions of medical experts
      regarding the prognosis of patients exhibiting certain patterns of clinical or
      laboratory data.

TI  - The Erlangen university hospital communication hub--proprietary and standardised 
      communication.
PG  - 995-8
AB  - The University of Erlangen-Nuremberg contains 22 hospitals and 11 autonomous
      medical departments which are spread out over a large area in the city of
      Erlangen. The necessary connections of these units and their computer based
      subsystems to each other and to the medical computer centre via fibre optics
      cables is complete. The internal cabling of the individual units is largely
      completed. Based on this network the Erlangen communication hub allows medical
      subsystems of the Erlangen university hospitals to exchange data by two
      completely different methods. Since 1995 a communication data base, which is
      implemented using the relational data base system ADABAS D, contains data from
      the most important hospital systems. This data can be accessed by other medical
      systems. Thus the communication data base allows subsystems which do not have a
      standardised interface to implement proprietary system interconnections via
      access based on SQL. The capabilities of this interconnection are dependent on
      both the implementation and the data which is made available by the communication
      data base. This contains mainly basic patient data and the results of tests
      performed by various laboratory systems. In addition to this proprietary
      communication system we have since the end of 1996 a communication server which
      can also handle standardised message formats such as HL7, EDIFACT, DICOM3. Future
      subsystems which possess standard interfaces will be connected via this server.
      The connection of the patient management system IS-H and the central laboratory
      system to the database has been proceeding since the beginning of 1997.

TI  - A patient-centric approach to telemedicine database development.
PG  - 67-73
AB  - Computer and telecommunications technologies have unleashed a wide range of
      powerful tools for gathering, storing, and distributing patient information.
      Computerized records enable healthcare providers to rapidly access patient data
      and to closely monitor patients from a distance. These significant advantages can
      be further extended by using the technology to more fully involve patients in
      their own healthcare management. A patient-centric approach to telemedicine means
      that the patient takes on additional responsibility and control, and the benefits
      from increased patient involvement will translate into improved compliance,
      reduced litigation, lower costs, and better outcomes. Furthermore, there are
      often important ethical questions that are best decided by the informed patient. 
      Patients have a right to know what information is being gathered and who will be 
      authorized to access that information. Current health information systems do not 
      adequately address these issues, and telemedicine applications--particularly home
      based telemedicine--is forcing everyone to take a closer look at patients' roles 
      in their own healthcare. In this presentation, a patient-centric home
      telemedicine database is described, the limitations are discussed, and future
      directions are proposed.

TI  - Automating and improving the data quality of a nursing department quality
      management program at a university hospital.
PG  - 623-35
AB  - BACKGROUND: The development and implementation of a relational database program
      for nursing quality management at a university hospital was stimulated by a lack 
      of consistent data management and analysis tools in the existing noncomputerized 
      program. PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION: An initial software prototype
      implemented in the critical care service included data collection instruments for
      five areas: medication errors, patient falls, returns to an intensive care unit
      within 48 hours, hospital-acquired skin breakdown, and unplanned extubations.
      Access to the database was limited and paper reports only were disseminated on a 
      scheduled basis. In a second phase, the database is being deployed throughout the
      nursing department using a local area network. Nurse managers will enter and
      interact with the quality database online and have access to graphics, reports,
      and action plan development. POSSIBLE ERRORS: A wide range of potential errors
      influences decisions on how to collect, store, retrieve, and process quality
      management data. Each type of error affects the nurse manager's ability to
      identify significant patterns or trends that are amenable to intervention. There 
      is no right way of constructing and implementing a quality improvement database; 
      only an optimum balance between cost, complexity, and efficacy. SUMMARY AND
      CONCLUSIONS: Initial feedback from end uses has been positive. A three-year
      experience with a personal computer database suggests that the personal
      computer-based information technology is appropriate for small to medium
      applications and can support departmentwide CQI efforts. A case scenario using
      simulated data is included to illustrate the use of computerized reports in
      assessing and taking action on an increase in falls.

TI  - Outcomes assessment in the NCCN.
PG  - 137-40
AB  - Outcomes assessment has two primary goals: the evaluation of treatments and the
      evaluation of quality of care. Data on the outcomes associated with specific
      interventions may provide an empiric basis for guidelines in areas for which no
      randomized trial data are available. Also, monitoring of patterns of care and
      outcomes is an essential component of institutional efforts to implement
      guidelines and to benchmark themselves against regional and national norms. The
      National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) has adopted a three-phase approach
      to its outcomes assessment program. Phase 1, already completed, involved taking a
      systematic inventory of members' existing institutional data sources. Phase 2,
      which is currently in progress, entails pooling data from existing outcomes data 
      bases. In particular, tumor registry data from the National Cancer Data Base are 
      being used to examine patterns of care and outcomes in NCCN institutions and to
      benchmark them against national norms. Phase 3, begun within the past year,
      involves the creation of a uniform outcomes assessment system for the NCCN.

TI  - A framework for the integration of distributed autonomous healthcare information 
      systems.
PG  - 325-35
AB  - This paper presents a domain-specific framework for the integration of
      geographically distributed heterogeneous autonomous healthcare information
      systems. Integration is seen and understood in terms of access to information
      resources, and in terms of content, structure, and visualization of patient
      record segments, with the goal of creating a virtual patient record at the
      medical workstations. The proposed approach covers integration aspects related to
      presentation, control, data, and function. The architecture and the components of
      the framework are based on the newly introduced Patient Meta-Record (PMR)
      concept, but also make use of existing or emerging standards for distributed
      object-oriented computing and information presentation. At the application and
      middle-ware layers of the presented healthcare information systems architecture, 
      the PMR concept enhances or enables services for data mediation, distributed
      directory access, and workflow management. At the bitways layer, high performance
      networks provide a fast medium, which is indispensable for medical image
      distribution, collaborative work, hypermedia library applications, and
      teleconsultation.

TI  - Implementation of a patient-centred and physician-oriented healthcare information
      system.
PG  - 207-14
AB  - Integration of information has enabled expeditious operation in air transfer,
      banking, shopping, and stock brokerage, but not in healthcare. Existing health
      information systems (HIS) are concerned too much with departmental performance
      and charge billing, and neglect the end users--the patients and the physicians.
      The resultant HIS then has divergent operation to antagonize the physicians, and 
      has fragmented data to the disadvantage of patients. Recognizing the problems and
      the trend of HIS, this study proposed and implemented a patient-centred and
      physician-oriented HIS in a Urology clinic. The proposed HIS had patient care as 
      its core, and accurately coded the patient's diagnoses and therapy information.
      It also offered a friendly environment and complete function for the physician to
      administrate medical records and to provide healthcare services. The HIS had
      client/server structure and an open system to protect the hardware investment and
      the software implementation. It will be the key to success in complete hospital
      environments.

TI  - Anesthesia information-management systems: their role in risk-versus cost
      assessment and outcomes research.
PG  - 2-5; discussion 24-5
AB  - Computerized clinical information systems clearly have a role in this era of
      managed care when outcomes research and cost/benefit analyses are becoming
      crucial. Despite anesthesiologists' leadership in developing physician-entry
      systems, automated recordkeeping systems have been underused. This report reviews
      the problems and possible solutions associated with establishing more effective
      and user-friendly systems in the anesthesia specialty. A key feature of any
      cost/benefit analysis or outcome study is the precise definition of data to be
      collected. Redesign of anesthesia information systems will be required to assist 
      users to enter events according to standardized definitions. To filter the vast
      amount of data collected by electronic medical-records systems in the ordinary
      course of care that are not applicable to a specific study, some form of
      filtering or data reduction on transfer to research or administrative databases
      will be needed. To allow careful analysis of possible correlations of outcome to 
      care choices requires both the capture of the clinical context-a detailed
      description of all relevant conditions extending well beyond merely the objective
      vital signs-throughout a specific medical episode and the establishment of
      postoperative evaluation systems to allow outcomes capture. Connections to new as
      well as existing outcome data will provide vast new opportunities for outcomes
      research.

TI  - Toward implementation of artificial neural networks that "really work".
PG  - 183-7
AB  - Artificial neural networks are established analytical methods in bio-medical
      research. They have repeatedly outperformed traditional tools for pattern
      recognition and clinical outcome prediction while assuring continued adaptation
      and learning. However, successful experimental neural networks systems seldom
      reach a production state. That is, they are not incorporated into clinical
      information systems. It could be speculated that neural networks simply must
      undergo a lengthy acceptance process before they become part of the day to day
      operations of health care systems. However, our experience trying to incorporate 
      experimental neural networks into information systems lead us to believe that
      there are technical and operational barriers that greatly difficult neural
      network implementation. A solution for these problems may be the delineation of
      policies and procedures for neural network implementation and the development a
      new class of neural network client/server applications that fit the needs of
      current clinical information systems.

TI  - CytoBase: an electronic medical record for cervical cytology.
PG  - 37-41
AB  - A partnership of medical laboratories in Ontario, Canada has developed and made
      operational a centralized interactive database of cervical cytology (Pap)
      reports. This system automatically registers some 60,000 reports monthly, which
      are submitted electronically from geographically diverse sources. Patient
      histories are provided on-line to authorized pathologists to support ongoing
      diagnoses. A formalized coding system has been developed to represent elements of
      Pap reports in machine readable format, including diagnosis, clinical information
      about the patient, specimen adequacy, methods of specimen collection and
      follow-up recommendations. The system operates over a private network based on
      Internet standards. A review of operations, which commenced June 1, 1996,
      provides insights into applied EMR technology.

TI  - A novel tele-medical environment appropriate for use in tele-advisory and
      tele-surgery cases.
PG  - 187-91
AB  - Tele-medical systems have been recently introduced in the field of networking as 
      promising applications that can significantly improve the offering of medical
      treatment by providing services such as tele-advising, tele-surgery and remote
      monitoring in places where the presence of doctors or any medical specialists is 
      difficult or time consuming. Some already existent networking models can be used 
      for the establishment of a connection between the communicating sides. The
      offered network's security is also a significant factor. The present paper
      describes a software environment implementing a particular aspect of a
      tele-medical system. The developed system includes features such as direct
      communication between doctors and medical assistants, medical information
      acquisition and storing and high band information transfer in real-time. TCP/IP
      point-to-point protocol has been used for the implementation of the non
      bandwidth-critical connections. The application introduces novel features with
      the use of ATM connection for supporting the time-critical service of video
      transfer to and from the medical database.

AB  - A multimedia medical database model and prototype is described for supporting a
      timeline-based presentation of information. The database links image and text
      data in a way that permits users to look at medical information in a single
      unified view. Various visualization programs permit the user to view data in
      various ways, including full image views, graphs, and tables. Our technology is
      applied for proof-of-concept to two areas: thoracic oncology and thermal tumor
      ablation therapy of the brain. This effort is part of the multidisciplinary KMeD 
      project in collaboration with medical research and clinical treatment projects at
      UCLA.

PG  - 25-36
AB  - Current digital information systems in radiology are insufficient to accommodate 
      the retrieval needs of academicians. Significant efforts are required in
      retrieving clinical cases for teaching and research. We describe a prototype
      system that supports intelligent case retrieval based on a combined specification
      of patient demographics, radiologic findings, and pathologic diagnoses. The
      documents for these cases can be distributed among multiple heterogeneous data
      bases. The system features automatic indexing of radiology and pathology reports,
      a comprehensive lexicon for thoracic radiology, an interface to a hospital
      information system, radiology information system, and picture archiving and
      communication systems, and a graphical user interface for query formulation and
      results visualization. The prototype system was developed within the domain of
      thoracic radiology involving patients with lung cancer.

TI  - Architectural design and tools to support the transparent access to hospital
      information systems, radiology information systems, and picture archiving and

PG  - 1-10
AB  - The fragmentation of the electronic patient record among hospital information
      systems (HIS), radiology information systems (RIS), and picture archiving and
      communication systems (PACS) makes the viewing of the complete medical patient
      record inconvenient. The purpose of this report is to describe the system
      architecture, development tools, and implementation issues related to providing
      transparent access to HIS, RIS, and PACS information. A client-mediator-server
      architecture was implemented to facilitate the gathering and visualization of
      electronic medical records from these independent heterogeneous information
      systems. The architecture features intelligent data access agents, run-time
      determination of data access strategies, and an active patient cache. The
      development and management of the agents were facilitated by data integration
      CASE (computer-assisted software engineering) tools. HIS, RIS, and PACS data
      access and translation agents were successfully developed. All pathology,
      radiology, medical, laboratory, admissions, and radiology reports for a patient
      are available for review from a single integrated workstation interface. A data
      caching system provides fast access to active patient data. New network
      architectures are evolving that support the integration of heterogeneous software
      subsystems. Commercial tools are available to assist in the integration
      procedure.

PG  - 638-42
AB  - Attention to an architectural framework in the development of clinical
      applications can promote reusability of both legacy systems as well as newly
      designed software. We describe one approach to an architecture for a clinical
      workstation application which is based on a critical middle tier of distributed
      object-oriented services. This tier of network-based services provides
      flexibility in the creation of both the user interface and the database tiers. We
      developed a clinical workstation for ambulatory care using this architecture,
      defining a number of core services including those for vocabulary, patient index,
      documents, charting, security, and encounter management. These services can be
      implemented through proprietary or more standard distributed object interfaces
      such as CORBA and OLE. Services are accessed over the network by a collection of 
      user interface components which can be mixed and matched to form a variety of
      interface styles. These services have also been reused with several applications 
      based on World Wide Web browser interfaces.

TI  - Electronically distributed, computer-generated, individualized feedback enhances 
      the use of a computerized practice guideline.
PG  - 493-7
AB  - Clinical guidelines have been developed to assist with the management of patient 
      care; however, these guidelines are frequently neglected in clinical practice.
      Computer-generated reminders enhance guideline use, but these systems often fail 
      to achieve high rates of guideline utilization. This study was designed to test
      the hypothesis that computer-generated, individualized feedback regarding
      adherence to care guidelines will significantly improve clinician compliance with
      guideline recommendations presented through a computer-assisted management
      protocol. Half of the 45 primary care clinicians employed at a primary care
      clinic affiliated with an academic medical center, were randomized to receive a
      biweekly electronic mail message consisting of a computer-generated report
      summarizing his/her response to care guideline recommendations for the diabetic
      patients seen during the previous 2 weeks. Clinician compliance with guideline
      recommendations was the primary outcome measure. This study demonstrated that the
      intervention significantly increased clinician compliance with the guideline
      recommendations without incurring high maintenance expenses. Median compliance

      regarding clinician use of care guideline recommendations is an effective way to 
      enhance compliance with a care guideline.

TI  - The medical information highway: where is the access ramp?
PG  - 57-61
AB  - In this article, an analogy is drawn between a health care information system and
      a freeway transportation system. Unfinished access ramps and disconnected road
      sections are likened to unlinked computer information systems. It is not until
      there is "connectivity" between roadways that vehicles can take advantage of the 
      efficiencies of a freeway system or until there are comprehensive, integrated
      information systems that quality health care can be provided. The Greater
      Victoria Hospital Society used quality improvement techniques to improve the
      medical information highway, and theories of change management to encourage
      physician leaders to "buy into" the information system to produce needed change
      in the organization and in patient care.

TI  - Writing a PACS program statement.
PG  - 41-50
AB  - Medical telecommunications is becoming a necessity for maintaining the quality of
      care and delivering services on a timely basis in the current environment of
      cutting services and specialists to reduce costs. (Vanden Brink 1994). Picture
      archiving and communications systems (PACS) and teleradiology are increasingly
      viable because there is easier connectivity among modalities and manufacturers.
      Agreement on the DICOM Standard is one step toward greater connectivity.
      Two-thirds of the 350 radiology administrators, radiologists, hospital
      administrators and MIS directors interviewed for the 1994 IMACS/PACS Tracking
      Study believe that the use of image telecommunication technology is growing. In
      1993, Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) formed a committee to evaluate 
      the need for PACS and to compile a program statement. The principal purpose of
      the program statement is to provide fundamental information that can be
      understood easily by individuals outside the radiology department. It outlines
      the benefits of PACS and includes a financial analysis of the purchase and
      installation of a system. Key elements of the program statement include a
      description and analysis of the existing film library system, advantages of PACS,
      implementation plan, financial proforma and integration with the hospital
      information system. These and other topics are covered in detail in the following
      article.

TI  - Integrating legacy laboratory information systems into a client-server world: the
      University of Minnesota Clinical Workstation (CWS) project.
PG  - 289-96
AB  - The development of an innovative clinical decision-support project such as the
      University of Minnesota's Clinical Workstation initiative mandates the use of
      modern client-server network architectures. Preexisting conventional laboratory
      information systems (LIS) cannot be quickly replaced with client-server
      equivalents because of the cost and relative unavailability of such systems.
      Thus, embedding strategies that effectively integrate legacy information systems 
      are needed. Our strategy led to the adoption of a multi-layered connection
      architecture that provides a data feed from our existing LIS to a new
      network-based relational database management system. By careful design, we
      maximize the use of open standards in our layered connection structure to provide
      data, requisition, or event messaging in several formats. Each layer is optimized
      to provide needed services to existing hospital clients and is well positioned to
      support future hospital network clients.

TI  - Use of data in a radiology information system for labeling computed radiographs: 
      an interface to connect the two systems.
PG  - 745-7
AB  - Computers have greatly facilitated the processing and storage of radiologic
      information. Manufacturers of radiology information systems (RISs) are gradually 
      incorporating options for interfacing their products with other computers (e.g., 
      hospital information systems). However, a growing need exists to also interface
      RISs with digital radiologic equipment so that images (e.g., computed radiographs
      of the chest and skeleton) are automatically labeled with identification data.
      Such connectivity would eliminate redundant work by technologists, decrease
      errors in the labeling of images, and increase the consistency of patients' data 
      within a radiology department. Unfortunately, the rapid advances in digital
      technology, combined with the lack of a well-defined standard for the transfer of
      demographic information between dissimilar systems, have delayed development of
      these interfaces. We have developed a widely applicable method to automatically
      transfer patients' demographic data from an RIS to a commercially available
      computed radiography system. A personal computer is configured with inexpensive
      programmable telecommunications software to create an interactive gateway, which 
      eliminates the need for redundant data entry (compared with entering data once on
      the RIS and again on the stand-alone computed radiography system), and thus also 
      decreases errors in the labeling of images.

TI  - A national quality improvement effort: cancer registry data.
PG  - 155-61
AB  - Cancer registries are sources of epidemiological, patterns-of-care, and outcome
      data for local, regional, state, and national studies of patients with cancer.
      Since 1976, these registries have formed a voluntary network of contributors to
      annual patient care studies under the aegis of the National Cancer Data Committee
      of the Commission on Cancer. These annual studies provide timely clinical
      information that is widely disseminated to physicians, allied health personnel,
      administrators, health care planners, and public and private agencies. The use of
      the data has grown exponentially and has been the basis for more than 90
      publications. Merging this activity with the National Cancer Data Base has
      further expanded the demand and use of registry data. This study was undertaken
      to respond to inquiries as to the validity of the data and the qualifications and
      competency of cancer registrars. It provides the baseline for cancer registry
      data quality and serves as a quality management tool to identify opportunities to
      enhance data quality.

TI  - Uncertainty and decisions in medical informatics.
PG  - 111-21
AB  - This paper presents a tutorial introduction to the handling of uncertainty and
      decision-making in medical reasoning systems. It focuses on the central role of
      uncertainty in all of medicine and identifies the major themes that arise in
      research papers. It then reviews simple Bayesian formulations of the problem and 
      pursues the generalization to the Bayesian network methods that are popular
      today. Decision making is presented from the decision analysis viewpoint, with
      brief mention of recently-developed methods. The paper concludes with review of
      more abstract characterization of uncertainty, and anticipates the growing
      importance of analytic and "data mining" techniques as growing amounts of
      clinical data become widely available.

TI  - Reasoning in expert system ONE for vertigo work-up.
PG  - 207-8
AB  - An otoneurological expert system (ONE) was developed to help collect data and
      diagnose the work-up of vertigo of both central and peripheral diseases causing
      vertigo. Patient history and otoneurological and other examination results are
      used in the reasoning process. The history is interactively collected and is
      complemented with clinical examination results. The case history data can be
      either mandatory or supportive. Mandatory questions are used to confirm a
      diagnosis, and conflicting answers are used to reject an unlikely disease.
      Supportive questions support or suppress a diagnosis, but their presence is not
      obligatory. The reasoning procedure of ONE scores every question independently
      for different diagnoses, depending on how well they agree with the symptom entity
      of a disease. Diagnostic criteria are set for each disease, in Meniere's disease,
      for example, the full triad is required. Graphic displays illustrate the linear
      and nonlinear correlation between the symptoms and diseases. For instance, both
      second-long Tumarkin-type attacks and attacks lasting hours give a high score
      while intermediately long attacks score much lower in Meniere's disease. To be
      able to take even rare diseases into consideration we try to diminish the
      possibility of a wrong decision rather than maximize the likelihood of reaching
      only one right decision.

      Research.
PG  - 48-56
AB  - We are creating a health care information network that will link a large
      community medical record system to three hospital emergency departments, fifty
      community pharmacies, ten clinics, four health-maintenance organization (HMO)
      offices, and twelve homeless care sites in Indianapolis, Indiana. This project
      will test the feasibility of linking care providers across organizational
      boundaries and measure the benefits of such a network. The network will supply
      three kinds of information services: a "mini-medical library," patient medical
      record information, and a citywide prescription database incorporating a
      computer-based prescription-writing system. The use of medical resources, the
      cost of care, provider time spent giving care, and providers' opinions of the
      services will be used as outcomes in randomized clinical trials. Through this
      project, we hope to expand the information base available to the target care
      sites; reduce unnecessary testing and increase the efficiency of care in
      emergency departments; improve emergency department, office, and clinic
      prescribing patterns; enlarge the consortium of health care providers connected
      by the network; and develop strategies for successfully implementing a
      comprehensive city medical record resource.

TI  - "Auctoritas" psychiatric expert system shell.
PG  - 997
AB  - We present a short description of a complex psychiatric computer expert system,
      including functions that help the physicians and the hospital staff in the
      administrative, diagnostic, therapeutic, statistical, and scientific work. There 
      are separate data-storing, health insurance-supporting, or simple advisory
      programs, but we can not avail a system--in our country--that provides us with
      all these functions together. Hence the aim of our program is to produce a
      universal computer system that makes the patients' long distance follow-up
      possible. Our diagnostic expert system shell, which is appropriate for using the 
      symptoms and criteria scheme of the internationally accepted diagnostic systems
      such as DSM and ICD, helps to archive homogeneous, up-to-date psychiatric
      nosology; this is essential for the correct diagnostic, statistical, and
      scientific work. Let us introduce our expert system. It consists of four parts:
      administration, diagnostic decision support system, activities concerning
      treatment, and statistics. The part called "Administration" contains all data
      about actual and emitted in-patients and out-patients, including their
      particulars and data necessary for health insurance (duration of treatment,
      diagnosis); here we find and edit medical documents. The most important part of
      the "Auctoritas" system is the "Diagnostic decision support system." In practice,
      expert systems use decision trees with yes-no logic, fuzzy logic, and pattern
      matching on the basis of the method of deduction; and backward chaining or
      forward chaining on the basis of the direction of deduction. Our system uses the 
      methods of fuzzy logic and backward chaining. In other medical disciplines, good 
      results are achieved by applying the pattern matching method; to make validity
      and verification researches, however, these systems are inappropriate. The
      diagnoses relying on the up-to-date psychiatric diagnostic systems--DSM-IV and
      ICD-X--are based on classical logic and can be correctly validated and verified. 
      Hence we have chosen the fuzzy logic, which is the up-to-date extension of
      classical logic and influences the validity and verification researches, for the 
      construction of our system. The diagnostic part is a shell that can be filled up 
      optionally with knowledge bases of the DSM-IV, ICD-X, or other diagnostic systems
      and has the following structure. The diagnostic course is biphased as we can
      differ symptoms and criteria (duration of the illness, aethyological factors). We
      managed to extend the traditional applications using yes-no logic with three
      factors that make the system more sensitive and flexible. These are the scaling, 
      sorting by importance of symptoms, and reliability-validity results. The
      "scaling" means that the physician scales the input symptoms by severity; this
      influences the statistical probability of the possible diagnoses. "Sorting by
      importance" is gauging certain symptoms by importance in a syndrome. Finally the 
      third point, "reliability-validity results," means taking account of the latest
      validity values of a certain disorder of the used diagnostic system--according to
      the latest validity researches--and the diagnostical reliability of our expert
      system. The "Activity concerning treatment" is a practical part of our program
      that contents the examination and therapy scheduling and monitoring results.
      Under the point of "Statistics," we can prepare all data of the patients in
      various ways. In summary, the "Auctoritas" computer system is a global database
      managing the newly-developed advisory system; it is appropriate for managing a
      complete hospital network system for the continuing individual long-distance
      observation of patients. It collects all the necessary information of one patient
      in one file. The long-term benefit is that it can compile and process large
      amounts of information about the patients and help physicians come to scientific 
      conclusions for research and publications.

      preliminary results.
PG  - 1321-5
AB  - This paper describes a three phase evaluation of nursing work patterns on two
      University Hospital Giessen medical wards and the influence of introducing
      electronic data processing into the nursing environment. Results of the first
      phase are presented. The first phase was a baseline evaluation prior to the
      introduction of any electronic data processing functions. Work sampling showed
      that, on average, 15% of a nurse's time was spent providing general nursing care,
      35% on special nursing care, and 30% on administrative activities. The remaining 
      20% was used for activities not directly related to nursing. In addition, a
      survey was conducted, revealing that about one third of the nursing staff had had
      contact with computers prior to start of the study. The enthusiastic attitude
      toward using computers on the ward was striking. Nursing staff expected that
      their work would be easier after the introduction of computers, that electronic
      data processing would save time, and that the computers would be easy to use. The
      staff did not express such positive expectations for the use of bedside terminals
      or portable devices.

TI  - Implementation of a clinical workstation for general practice.
PG  - 777
AB  - It is now well recognized that achieving international best practice in the
      primary health sector will require the development of methods based on a
      fundamental integration of communications and information technologies with
      clinical practice. This will have far reaching effects, both on the pattern of
      medical practice and domiciliary care and on patient outcomes. In the past,
      information and communications technology has been presented as a tool for
      management, rather than as a tool for supporting, improving, and making more
      efficient the professional practice of medicine and the delivery of health care
      to the patient and the community. In this paper, we propose that an essential
      element for the achievement of international best practice in the health sector
      is the development and widespread use of information, measurement, and
      communications technology targeted towards the clinical practice of medicine, the
      provision of health services and domiciliary care in the community, and the
      analysis of morbidity patterns and health care outcomes. A key element of this
      strategy is the development of an integrated Clinical Workstation specifically
      designed for the general practitioner, practice nurses, and domiciliary care
      nurses in their professional tasks of measurement, diagnosis, management, and
      delivery of health care to the community. We will present our work on the design 
      of an integrated Clinical Workstation for Primary Health Care. The Workstation is
      Windows based, has a sophisticated user interface, and supports a wide range of
      computing platforms, from desktop to laptop to hand-held notebook computers. The 
      Workstation will be modular and expandable, both in its software and hardware
      components, so that users may select only those modules appropriate to their own 
      roles, clinical practice, and levels of expertise. The design will focus on the
      provision of clinical services and will integrate the following key components:
      Patient records and basic practice management; Clinical records. Based on ICD10, 
      ICPC, or Read Code classifications; Clinical measurements. Blood pressure,
      spirometry, ECG, and basic hematology and biochemistry; Clinical decision
      support. Based on epidemiologic data, protocols, and medical expert systems;
      Domiciliary care and evaluation of the functional health status of the elderly;
      Communications and networks. Wireless LAN, modem, and fax; Clinical reporting.
      Morbidity profiles prescribing profiles, and laboratory services and procedures. 
      Implementation of these requirements will ultimately take the form of an
      untethered, portable notepad computer supporting a communications link via modem,
      LAN, or wireless LAN, and removable instrumentation and clinical measurement
      modules.

TI  - Evaluation of bi-level image converting methods for nuclear medicine image
      database stored in the IS&C magneto-optical disk.
PG  - 442
AB  - 1. INTRODUCTION. We have developed a report and imaging management system for
      nuclear medicine. The report and image data are stored in the IS&C
      magneto-optical disk (IS&C MOD). Nuclear medicine image data are relatively
      small, but they are large enough to create problems when being transported over a
      low-speed Hospital Information System (HIS) network. Moreover, gray scale image
      output devices (i.e., high-resolution displays, sonoprinters) are expensive. If
      high quality bi-level (black and white) images were available, images could be
      transferred through low-speed network with inexpensive bi-level terminals or
      conventional page-printers. We examined images using several bi-level image
      conversion techniques [1, 2] in order to determine how useful the bi-level images
      are and to assess their suitability for use in nuclear medicine. The images were 
      compared with original film images by ROC analysis. The modified minimized
      average error method was found to be superior to other methods in bone and
      gallium images. Its A-values are 0.83 in gallium scan and 0.85 in bone scan. 2.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS. Our system consists of three digital gamma cameras, a
      nuclear medicine data processing unit, two UNIX stations, and two personal
      computers. The computers and the data processing unit are connected via Ethernet 
      and each computer has an IS&C MOD unit. Image and report data are stored in the
      IS&C MOD. The computers are also connected off-line through the IS&C MOD. To
      evaluate image quality, bone scan images and gallium scan images (1024x512,
      2048x1024 pixels and 16 bits depth) were converted to bi-level images (same
      pixels and one bit depth) using four methods: dither method, minimized average
      error method (MAE)[1], modified regional adaptation method, and constrained
      average method. For the dither methods, three sets of dither matrix (Fatting's,
      Bayer's and our original matrix) were employed. The computer images were compared
      with original film images by ROC analysis. 3. RESULTS. The converted bi-level
      images were 1/16 the size of the originals. They were transferred via Ethernet,
      displayed on the monochrome display, and printed using a conventional
      page-printer (240 dpi or 300 dpi). The A-values of the original gallium and bone 
      images on the films were 0.89 and 0.94. Modified MAE method gave better results
      than other methods tested, with the gallium image using this technique reading
      0.83 on the A-scale; and the bone images were 0.85. 4. DISCUSSION. Generally,
      nuclear medicine images require lower spatial and gray level resolution than
      other computer imaging techniques. We compared four bi-level image conversion
      methods in order to know which methods are suitable to nuclear medicine images.
      The ROC analysis was employed to evaluate these image qualities. The MAE methods 
      made particular texture pattern as artifacts in the intermediate gray level area.
      But it can express homogeneity the neutral level. The dither method images are
      coarse texture. It affects detectabilities of subtle abnormal findings. 5.
      CONCLUSIONS. The A-z values of the modified MAE images were comparable to those
      of original film images. Although bone images give slightly lower values, many
      abnormal findings can be ascertained on bi-level images. High quality bi-level
      image techniques are considered to be useful for nuclear medicine image database 
      systems.

TI  - Image engine: an integrated multimedia clinical information system.
PG  - 421-5
AB  - Image Engine is a microcomputer-based system for the integration, storage,
      retrieval, and sharing of digitized clinical images. The system seeks to address 
      the problem of integrating a wide range of clinically important images with the
      text-based electronic patient record. Rather than create a single, integrated
      database system for all clinical data, we are developing a separate image
      database system that creates real-time, dynamic links to other network-based
      clinical databases. To the user, this system will present an integrated
      multimedia representation of the patient record, providing access to both the
      image and text-based data required for effective clinical decision making.

TI  - A semantic network model for the medical record of a rheumatology clinic.
PG  - 240-4
AB  - For the development of a rheumatology information system, a medical data
      dictionary was developed that supports all phases of software development. In the
      design phase, the medical expert described his clinical environment and the
      rheumatology medical record in a semantic network structure. Causal relationships
      between different items of the medical record (e.g., a problem may be related to 
      an adverse drug event caused by a particular drug) are also represented in the
      semantic network and transferred into referential integrity constraints of the
      patient database. Furthermore, by also integrating the domain management as a
      feature of the medical data dictionary, the elementary attributes of the medical 
      record and the associated lists of valid attribute entries have also been defined
      within the semantic network. This structure allowed the automatic generation of
      data entry screens, thus making the clinical applications as independent from any
      hardcoded program module as possible.

TI  - Cost-effective health information systems: user-driven internal development at
      the University of Iowa.
PG  - 703-7
AB  - GOALS: The Information Network For Online Retrieval & Medical Management
      (INFORMM), health information system (HIS) for the University of Iowa Hospitals
      and Clinics (UIHC), was analyzed with regard to development of a Computer-Based
      Patient Record (CBPR) in a cost-effective manner. The analysis: i) profiles
      INFORMM system functionality; ii) displays INFORMM use and satisfaction among
      physicians, nurses, and other hospital employees; iii) characterizes dynamics
      affecting INFORMM growth; and iv) evaluates the cost of a system of
      internal-development of software. DATA SOURCES: INFORMM utilization for 1989,
      1994, and 1995; service requests from users for the years 1985, 1990, and 1994;
      1994 MECON-PEERx data; gap analysis user survey conducted by an independent
      consulting firm. MAIN RESULTS: 1) Physician use has been dominated by a single
      function: retrieval of laboratory results. 2) Nurse use of the system was more
      diverse. A recent surge of nurse and physician use resulted from the introduction
      of online documentation of nursing care. 3) Overall use has been predominantly by
      non-clinician users, no one function dominating their pattern of use. 4) User
      service requests were predominantly from the non-clinician group of users.
      Requests from non-physician groups have been coordinated by a limited number of
      representatives of those groups, unlike requests from physicians. 5) The UIHC HIS
      ranked high in user satisfaction. 6) The overall cost of the UIHC HIS system is
      relatively low as a percentage of the gross operating budget or as a ratio to the
      volume of patient activities in this medical center. CONCLUSIONS: Internal
      development of INFORMM has been a cost-effective solution to the information
      demands of nursing staff and other users. INFORMM system composition reflects the
      quantity and organization of user requests. Satisfying the needs of physicians
      requires a change in the manner in which physician needs are assessed.

TI  - Improving report turnaround time: an integrated method using data from a
      radiology information system.
PG  - 1503-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In the face of a changing health care system and increased
      competition, radiology departments need to become more efficient. One measurement
      of efficiency is promptness in producing a final report. Many large radiology
      centers have radiology information systems (RIS) that track work flow, collecting
      tremendous amounts of data. Most, however, lack an appropriate analytic
      mechanism. We have developed an integrated system that allows continual
      monitoring of radiology work flow and thus of opportunities to apply
      interventions. This system can form an important component of the quality
      management process in the radiology department. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In
      developing the system, we identified seven key steps in the work-flow process.
      When left to chance, these steps occur out of sequence and large delays occur. A 
      scheme was devised to improve the sequencing of the work flow by using the data
      collected from the RIS, sorted by radiology division and patient type. Biweekly, 
      the appropriate data file is transferred to each division for analysis, via the
      department's computer network. A one-step process follows, using desktop
      Macintosh computers and a custom program written in Microsoft Excel. Extracted
      data are quickly converted into a tailored division summary, and a report is
      automatically generated. RESULTS: The result summary format is uniform throughout
      the department, allowing ease of review at divisional and departmental meetings. 
      Problems can be immediately localized to a specific step in the work-flow
      process. Automation of much of the system allows continual, near-real-time review
      of work flow. Using this approach, we have seen a sustained reduction of average 
      report turnaround time. CONCLUSION: This system allows continual monitoring of
      work flow. It is largely automated and lends itself well to inclusion in the
      quality management program of any radiology department.

TI  - Hospital information system and patterns of cancer screening.
PG  - 335-42
AB  - Relative ease, implied accuracy, and unprecedented possibilities of computerized 
      health care information systems, is very tempting for researchers. Attempts at
      determining the referral patterns for cancer screening at a large county hospital
      through the use of computerized administrative and clinical files, and some of
      the problems encountered is reported here. Only 17% of women over 18, and 16% of 
      women over 50 who visited this hospital were referred and received screening for 
      cervical and breast cancer, respectively. Pap testing was concentrated at clinics
      dealing with reproductive health, and women with higher visit frequencies had a
      higher referral rate. Major problems encountered were lack of uniformity in
      capturing information for similar variables in different files, inconsistency in 
      capturing data elements, and partial coverage. To enhance capabilities of
      computerized health information system, following principles must be incorporated
      in the designs: complete coverage, uniform collection of data across time and
      files, and inclusion of linking capabilities.

TI  - Users conceptual views on medical information databases.
PG  - 93-104
AB  - As information databases we consider all the kinds of information repositories
      that are handled by computer systems. When querying very large information
      databases, the end-users are often faced with the problem to parse their
      questions efficiently into the query languages of the computer systems.
      Conceptual graphs were initially designed for natural language analysis and
      understanding. Due to their closeness to semantic networks, their expressiveness 
      is powerful enough to be applied to knowledge representation and use by computer 
      systems. This work demonstrates that conceptual graphs are a suitable means to
      model both the information in patient databases and the queries to these
      databases, and that operations on graphs can compute the pattern matching process
      needed to provide the answers. A prototype that exploits this model is presented.
      Experiments have been made with the material furnished by the Unified Medical
      Language System project (version 2, 1992) of the National Library of Medicine,
      USA.

PG  - 161-6
AB  - The National Library of Medicine is currently funding the Pilot Connections
      project to promote and support use of the INTERNET in community health care
      settings. With previous networking applications of this kind largely confined to 
      academic and research environments, the health librarian has emerged as the agent
      with the unique knowledge and skills to participate in and manage organizational 
      change. An experiment in applied informatics, the Pilot Connections project shows
      how health librarians should be aware of the expanding opportunities that exist
      for them to help their organizations cope more effectively with the external
      trends and forces currently affecting the role and value of information.

TI  - Cost containment: Europe. Germany.
PG  - 364-74
AB  - The German healthcare system offers a social network guaranteeing almost complete
      healthcare coverage to the German population (prevention, treatment, and
      rehabilitation). The system is supported by a multistructured network of public
      and private healthcare insurers. Fees for public insurance are equally paid by
      employers and employees. Healthcare expenditures heavily impact the salary levels
      of employees and, as a result, production costs of employers. About one third of 
      all national healthcare spending goes to hospital care. In 1991, there were ICUs 
      in half of all German hospitals; 3.2% of all hospital beds were ICU beds. As in
      most countries, the expansion in national healthcare costs in the last decade has
      become a serious problem in Germany. At total of 8.1% of the entire German gross 
      national product is spent on health care, which has led to drastic governmental
      healthcare reform that began in 1993. The key points of this reform are: a)
      strict limitations on hospital budgets at 1992 levels including a new structure
      of hospital financing; b) controlled reduction of expenditures for medical drugs 
      (which were formerly at the highest level in Europe); and c) controlled
      restriction of regional distribution for physicians. In a large German university
      hospital (1,461 beds; 91 ICU beds) expenses for intensive care medicine comprise 
      about 12% of all hospital spending (5,356 deutsche mark/patient). More than 60%
      of these expenses are for personnel; 37% go toward drugs and medical materials.
      There are several possible starting points for cost containment in intensive care
      medicine in Germany: a) a task-adapted, countrywide diffusion of ICUs within the 
      different levels of hospitals; b) a more selective provision of intensive care
      medicine (primary as well as secondary) to patients, depending on patient needs; 
      c) a centralized and task-oriented admission and discharge policy; and d) cost
      containment in the use of drug therapy by centralized hospital purchasing and by 
      establishing strict, rational, therapeutic principles. Some examples of the
      author's personal experience follow. In all German hospitals, expenses for
      personnel are about 60% to 70%. These expenses are fixed by official, standard
      wages. Cost containment by further restricting the number of personnel impairs
      the care provided. Improvements in organization and management may contribute to 
      a higher degree of personal motivation for employees and, in turn, may result in 
      higher working efficiency.

PG  - 325-7
AB  - Administrative records of the Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA) and the
      National Death Index were linked to create a four-year longitudinal database that
      describes the clinical status, hospital and nursing home use, and mortality for a
      nationwide cohort of persons admitted to DVA nursing homes (n = 23,039). Using
      Social Security Numbers as identifiers, the records of only 6% of these persons
      had logically inconsistent or implausible patterns. Nineteen percent of the
      remaining records had correctable logical errors. Information on the creation,
      consistency, and potential uses of this database may prove useful to health
      services researchers interested in describing longitudinal patterns of health
      care use across multiple settings within and outside the DVA.

TI  - Object-oriented design of medical imaging software.
PG  - 125-35
AB  - A special software package for interactive display and manipulation of medical
      images was developed at the University Hospital of Geneva, as part of a hospital 
      wide Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS). This software package,
      called Osiris, was especially designed to be easily usable and adaptable to the
      needs of noncomputer-oriented physicians. The Osiris software has been developed 
      to allow the visualization of medical images obtained from any imaging modality. 
      It provides generic manipulation tools, processing tools, and analysis tools more
      specific to clinical applications. This software, based on an object-oriented
      paradigm, is portable and extensible. Osiris is available on two different
      operating systems: the Unix X-11/OSF-Motif based workstations, and the Macintosh 
      family.

TI  - A frame-relay approach for a state-wide health information network.
PG  - 416-20
AB  - An approach for a frame-relay implementation is described which is intended to
      establish connectivity between the health care providers in the state of
      Connecticut with a gateway to the internet. While other health care networking
      efforts have based the interconnectivity efforts on direct connections to the
      internet for each institution, our design takes a more cost effective approach by
      establishing a private health care network with a single entry point to the
      internet. This will not only provide the advantages of internet connections to
      all participating providers, but it will also isolate intrastate patient care
      traffic from the internet, reserving internet traffic for those information needs
      not available within the statewide network. In addition to the network solution, 
      an extensive user support infrastructure is also presented.

TI  - Implementation of a relational patient record with integration of educational and
      reference information.
PG  - 125-9
AB  - The clinician must identify pertinent diagnostic information and develop
      appropriate medical management plans in the context of rapidly changing research 
      information, new therapeutic options and expanding diagnostic modalities. To
      assist in recognition of patterns relevant to diagnostic or therapeutic
      interventions, the medical record must be presented in a format that emphasizes
      important data interrelationships. Reference and educational information
      specifically pertinent to the case being reviewed must be immediately accessible.
      A system that presents point of care patient centered clinical information, a
      summarized patient record, in a relational format with linked reference
      information has been developed. Data is acquired from the VA patient information 
      database and provided over a PC network. At the time of data transfer,
      preliminary analysis and reorganization of data is performed such that
      interrelationships between laboratory, pharmacy and diagnostic information can be
      rapidly recognized. During data compilation reference and educational information
      is linked with patient data such that it can be accessed with a mouse click
      ("hotspot") when the record is subsequently reviewed. The medical record and
      CD-ROM based reference databases are then made available to users on a PC network
      in a Windows (tm) environment. Initial experience with the system is very
      favorable and suggests that evaluation of patient data may be significantly
      enhanced.

TI  - Case-based telematic systems towards equity in health care. Introduction to the
      symposium.
PG  - 9-17
AB  - The theme of this International Symposium, co-sponsored by EFMI (the European
      Federation for Medical Informatics) and WHO-Eur (the European Office of the World
      Health Organisation) is made of four components: (1) an ethical principle: equity
      in health care, that aims to social justice; (2) measurements of equity that
      should be case-based/population related; (3) communication of this information at
      a wide scale, using telematics, e.g. integrated computer systems at distance; (4)
      actions to improve health care and equity in its delivery by using resource
      management tools and developing quality of care. The combination of these four
      elements is recommended as a coherent scheme for future actions of public
      authorities in health care. They were therefore associated in the somewhat
      complex title of the symposium. A special attention is given to the present
      degree of availability of a large number of case based/population related data
      sources in Europe, as well as on the need to develop generic models in
      telematics, rather than too strict standards at the user level. These information
      systems can be made easily accessible to clinicians and epidemiologists as an aid
      to their decision making in the European region.

PG  - 258-63
AB  - Tests on the transmission of view data processing images were undertaken for 5
      months from two experimental micro-processing sites specialized in medical
      imagery and linked to the R.N.I.S. network. The aim of the research was to
      validate the equipment and the software, and to find a way of working with regard
      problems related to long-distance diagnosis. Using an everyday equipment like
      Apple Macintosh II fx, 75 files were transferred corresponding in 375 images (1% 
      conventional X-ray, 5% digital angiography, 31% scanner and 63% M.R.I.). It has
      been found that the transfer of medical data is reliable (the images do not
      deteriorate), easy (less than 3 hours to be familiar with the program) and above 
      all fast (actual transfer time: 8.72 Ko per second). Neurosurgeon and
      neuroradiologist writers talk about their experience in this field.

      physicians.
PG  - 76-90
AB  - Innovative methods of providing workplace education for health care professionals
      may be a key to the survival of rural hospitals in America. Such methods must
      overcome time, distance, cost and organizational constraints, and take into
      account the structure of the learning experience. The Texas Hospital Education
      and Research Foundation has recently been involved in two programs that tested
      new approaches to worker education using distance-learning strategies. The
      projects--resource sharing among rural directors of nursing and training for
      cancer tumor registrars--used computer-conferencing technology. A new model using
      existing satellite, audio-conferencing, and computer-based instruction augmented 
      by computer conferencing is proposed. The Computer-Related Assisted Distance
      Learning Enhancement (CRADLE) model integrates existing technologies to provide
      education to health care workers at their desktop. The Cancer Learning Center
      (CLC) tested peer collaboration, the primary component of the model. The ultimate
      goal is to have the system available to all tumor registrars in Texas, and to
      secure funding to implement rural nursing and rural high-school health
      occupations education projects. Current projects from set-up through results are 
      presented.

PG  - 600-4
AB  - The archival database of the HELP Hospital Information System at LDS Hospital is 
      too large to be stored on line. The archival data are important for clinical and 
      research applications. Demountable disk packs have been used to store the
      archival database. This method of storage has four significant disadvantages. A
      virtual database was developed to overcome the limitations of this
      data-management scheme. This virtual database enables the transparent use of
      appropriate low-cost network-based storage technology to provide on-line
      availability of the entire archive of clinical data. The virtual database
      successfully resolves the problems associated with disk packs, and opens the door
      to enhanced use of the data for clinical and research applications.

TI  - TQuery: a context-sensitive temporal query language.
PG  - 401-19
AB  - Users of electronic medical databases request pertinent information by recasting 
      their clinical questions into a formal database query language. Because the query
      language is the user's only access to the data, the query language must be
      powerful enough to enable users to express their data requirements. However, a
      competing need is for the query language to be restrictive enough so that queries
      can have unambiguous semantics and the query processor can generate correct
      answers. We describe a query language, called TQuery , that was designed
      specifically to formulate database queries that are dependent on temporal and
      contextual relationships. TQuery specifications express contextual constraints
      without the need to explicitly reference calendar dates. TQuery is the database
      query language used to retrieve patient data from an object-oriented electronic
      patient medical-record system called the temporal network (TNET). TNET and TQuery
      were developed to support the real-time temporal reasoning and representation
      needs of a LISP workstation-based medical expert system.

PG  - 331-6
AB  - An artificial-neural-network-based drug interaction warning system was developed 
      for use with a computerized real-time entry medical records system. The goal of
      the study was to provide physicians and nurses with timely warnings of potential 
      drug interactions as therapies were prescribed. In a dialysis unit, physicians
      and clinical pharmacists defined rules of proper drug therapy, then trained a
      neural network with those rules. When the network was used to review the
      therapies of this patient population, a number of inconsistencies were
      discovered, and medication orders were changed on several patients. Real-time
      implementation of this monitoring system could provide messages to assure that
      drug therapy is consistent and proper, according to rules created by the
      providers of healthcare, thus preventing occasional mistakes in drug therapy.

TI  - Connecting healthcare providers. An effective computer network can create durable
      relationships.
PG  - 60-4
AB  - Physician networks are computerized systems that link primary care physicians and
      specialists to one another and to hospitals and other providers. The networks
      have four key components: communication, practice management, practice marketing,
      and diagnostic testing capabilities. Advantages of physician networks for
      hospitals include increased physician loyalty and increased market share through 
      additional admissions and outpatient registrations. From physicians' perspective,
      networks can help them expand their patient bases and increase revenue, provide
      additional services for existing patients, automate their offices, and improve
      their administrative efficiency. Networks also affect the way physicians practice
      medicine. Changes in practice patterns improve patient care, speed test results, 
      and improve physicians' relationships with each other and their patients. They
      also save time for physicians and their staff. In deciding whether to develop a
      network, executives must examine the architectural framework and components they 
      need, their commitment to physician relations, how reliant they are on primary
      care referrals, the competitive environment, the resources they are willing to
      commit, legal issues, and the physicians' role in planning.

TI  - Integrating medical images into hospital information systems.
PG  - 87-93
AB  - The effective delivery of health care has become increasingly dependent on a wide
      range of medical data that includes a variety of images. Manual and
      computer-based medical records ordinarily do not contain image data, leaving the 
      physician to deal with a fragmented patient record widely scattered throughout
      the hospital. The Department of Veterans Affairs is currently installing a
      prototype hospital information system workstation network to demonstrate the
      feasibility of providing image management and communications functionality as an 
      integral part of an existing hospital information system. The core of this system
      is a data base management system adapted to handle images as a new data type. A
      general model for this network-based integration is discussed and various
      alternative architectures are examined.

TI  - Data collection in the Great Plains Genetics Service Network: using limited funds
      to collect data from centers with varying resources.
PG  - 429-33
AB  - The Data Committee of the Great Plains Genetics Service Network (GPGSN)
      coordinates the collection of data relating to delivery of genetic services in
      eight states. These states are Iowa, Missouri, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Kansas,
      Nebraska, South Dakota and North Dakota. The funds allocated to this project by
      the GPGSN are limited. The distance between genetics service sites is great and
      the population density in the regions being served is low. The local resources
      available to the genetics services sites participating in data collection vary
      from robust to "bare-bones". The approach to solving the problem involved the
      following. First the committee the data items to be collected were identified and
      defined. Second, a standard format for transmitting the data to the GPGSN
      regional coordinating center in Iowa City was developed. Third, the services
      sites and their resources for collecting data were identified. Fourth, resources 
      were allocated to different sites in a manner that seemed most able to help that 
      center to contribute data to the regional center. Fifth, data were aggregated at 
      the regional center and aggregated data reports were returned to collecting
      sites. Finally, items were modified in response to the feedback received from the
      genetics services sites. Although the philosophy is that data collection should
      be a by-product of providing quality genetic services, the region recognizes that
      service sites will need help to conform with regional standards. Therefore the
      region encourages each service site to develop its own method to collect data,
      and provides assistance to it in getting the data into the regional transmission 
      format.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - CD-ROM MEDLINE use and users: information transfer in the clinical setting.
PG  - 224-32
AB  - Effective delivery of biomedical information to health professionals depends on
      the availability of systems that are compatible with the information-seeking
      patterns of health professionals. MEDLINE is a major source of biomedical
      information, but has been available primarily through libraries via
      telecommunications networks. The recent availability of MEDLINE on CD-ROM has
      made it possible to provide MEDLINE directly to clinicians without the associated
      problems of telecommunications and online use charges. The MEDLINE on CD-ROM
      Evaluation Forum sponsored by the National Library of Medicine reported on
      clinicians' use of CD-ROM MEDLINE at seven different clinical settings. This
      article summarizes the findings from these sites and places them in the context
      of current understanding of information-seeking behaviors of health
      professionals. Key issues in the design and development of information
      technologies in the clinical setting are also articulated.

TI  - A multimedia medical communication link between a radiology department and an
      emergency department.
PG  - 92-8
AB  - The most critical aspect of a radiologist's work is communicating his findings to
      the attending physician responsible for the patient's care. This is also the part
      of the process that is least well organized and the most subject to failure. At
      the University of Ottawa Medical Communications Research Centre we are
      investigating technical means to improving communications between radiologists
      and attending physicians. We first introduce the radiology communication service 
      problem and show why it is essentially a multimedia communication problem. We
      then briefly describe a multimedia communication system designed and implemented 
      by our research team. The multimedia system consists of several work stations
      linked by the Hospital's local area network (LAN). Each physician work station
      comprises a Compaq 386/20-Mhz microcomputer with 16 Mbytes of RAM, a 500-Mbyte
      image disk, and an image memory that drives a 1,000-line monochrome monitor. The 
      images are digitized using a Konica laser-based film digitizer (2430 by 2000
      10-bit pixels for a standard chest radiograph). The multimedia file server
      manager station is built around a PC-AT compatible with a Northern Telecom
      Meridian SL-1ST digital PBX and a Meridian Mail digital voice messaging system.
      This last device is used to store voice data and is linked via the PBX to the
      workstations' digital telephones. A Sytek 6,000 LAN links all work stations to
      the file server. All data, image, and graphic information is transmitted via this
      network, while the twisted pair connections linking the digital PBX to the
      telephone sets are used for transmitting voice data.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250

TI  - Knowledge management as a decision support method: a diagnostic workup strategy
      application.
PG  - 113-35
AB  - We have explored the potential of a computer-based approach called "knowledge
      management" to aid in clinical problem solving and education. The major features 
      of the approach are its ability to support flexible and immediate access by a
      user to relevant knowledge and annotation and organization of the knowledge for
      personal use and subsequent retrieval. We illustrate this approach with its
      application to diagnostic workup strategy problems. In this application,
      knowledge may be in the form of static narrative text, diagrams, pictures,
      graphs, tables, flow charts, or bibliographic citations. Other more dynamic forms
      of knowledge may be the result of simulations, "what if" analyses or modeling,
      quantitative mathematical or statistical calculation, or heuristic inference.
      User assessment has demonstrated the system's ease of use and user perception of 
      its desirability, but underscores the need for a "critical mass" of knowledge
      before such an approach will be widely utilized.

TI  - PACS in practice: the status of the PACS project at the St. Radboud University
      Hospital. Part A: Introduction and the picture system.
PG  - 255-64
AB  - A so-called bottom-up approach of a Picture Archiving and Communication System
      (PACS) is initiated by existing clinical questions. It is investigated how far
      existing Data-Acquisition (DA) modalities combined with the existing computer
      infrastructure of the hospital can provide soil to a, at first local, PACS
      system. Examples of current research projects in Digital Subtraction Angiography 
      (DSA), Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) demonstrate 
      how image and raw data processing evolve from applications based on a general
      matrix manipulation software package to projects within the field of PACS.
      Starting from the existing facilities a stepwise increase of connections and
      expansions of required features is going to be brought about by separately
      considering the picture system, the communication system and the archive system. 
      A three step phasing is proposed: (1) Software linking; (2) Hardware linking:
      small scale; and (3) Hardware linking: local area network. Examples are given
      from the first phase, i.e. the development and expansion of software on existing 
      DA-modalities or processing hardware to receive the data on floppy disk, hard
      disk or tape. Data are converted and transported for further processing: (a)
      within the department; (b) between hospital departments; and (c) between research
      centres. With regard to the picture system special attention has to be given to
      the requirements for digitizing analogue film images and the reading of images
      from monitor screens instead of films on lightboxes.

TI  - Effect of a digital imaging network on physician behavior in an intensive care
      unit.
PG  - 41-4
AB  - This study examined the effect of a medical image management network on the
      behavior of physicians working in a medial intensive care unit (MICU). For 1
      year, 8-week periods during which chest radiographs were digitized and made
      available to MICU physicians on a digital display console were alternated with
      8-week periods during which only film images were available. Clinical efficacy
      during the periods was compared by measuring the time between completion of
      imaging examinations and initiation of specific clinical actions such as
      placement and positioning of tubes. Results indicate that the time required to
      take some clinical actions decreased with the immediate availability of images on
      the digital display console. Established procedures for obtaining radiologic
      information were altered by the digital imaging network. The time at which
      physicians viewed images changed, and consultations between MICU staff and
      radiologists decreased. These results indicate that behavior patterns are altered
      when a new technology replaces an existing one. Optimal use of this technology
      may require changes in the logistics of clinical practice.
